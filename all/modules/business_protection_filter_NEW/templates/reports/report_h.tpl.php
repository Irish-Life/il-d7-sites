    <h3>Needs and Objectives</h3>

    <p>Personal shareholder protection is an arrangement whereby the shareholders enter into a personal legal agreement to buy out a deceased shareholders family in the event of their death.</p>
    <p>To make sure they have the funds to fulfil their personal obligation under the agreement each shareholder personally effects life assurance cover which will be paid to the surviving shareholders on their death.</p>
    <p>The surviving shareholders then use the funds to buy out the deceased's next of kin in line with the legal agreement.</p>

    <h3>Personal Shareholder Protection</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this report is to detail how a personal shareholder protection arrangement would work to protect <?php echo $businessName ?> against the death of a shareholder and provide the deceased’s next of kin with an immediate lump sum.</p>
    <p>This report is based on the answers provided and the selected route chosen through the Business Protection Pathfinder. It is understood that cover is required by <?php echo $businessName ?> for personal shareholder protection. </p>

    <h3>Structuring the Arrangement</h3>
    <p>The arrangement provides money on the death of a shareholder to allow the surviving shareholders to buy out the deceased’s share in the company from their estate. It is arranged in two steps:</p>
    <h4>1. Life Assurance</h4>
    <p>Based on the company’s particular circumstances you have chosen to arrange cover on an own life in trust basis.</p>
     <p>Each shareholder who has signed up to the legal agreement takes out a protection plan on their own life for a sum assured equal to the value of their share of the company.</p>
     <p>Each plan is written under trust for the benefit of the other shareholders covered by the agreement.</p>
     <p>Each shareholder pays the premium on his / her own plan.</p>

    <h5>Quantifying the level of cover</h5>
    <p>The level of cover over all the contracts is the estimated value of the individuals share in the company. The level of cover will also be subject to full medical and financial underwriting.</p>
    
    <h4>2. Shareholders Legal Agreement:</h4>
    <p>All of the shareholders who are to benefit from the arrangement are party to the one legal agreement. This can be framed as a double option agreement that provides in the event of the death of a shareholder to allow:</p>
          <ul>
        <li>the surviving shareholders to exercise an option to compel the deceased's personal representatives to sell the deceased’s share in the company, or,</li>
        <li>the deceased's personal representatives to exercise an option to compel the surviving shareholders to buy the deceased’s share in the firm at the market value.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>If neither side exercise their options then the share is not bought back and goes through the deceased's estate to their next of kin.</p>
    <pagebreak>
    <h3>Tax Implications</h3>
    <u>Taxation of Plan Benefits – Own Life in Trust</u>
    <h4>Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</h4>
    <p>Capital Gains Tax will NOT apply to the sum assured. The proceeds of the personal shareholder protection arrangement payable on death are not liable to Capital Gains Tax under current legislation.</p>
    <h4>Inheritance Tax</h4>
    <p>Inheritance Tax will NOT apply.</p>
    <p>On death the proceeds of the plan are paid to the trustee(s) of the plan for the benefit of the surviving shareholders who are party to the arrangement. Revenue have clarified that the proceeds of such a plan are exempt from Inheritance Tax in the hands of surviving shareholders, where they use the proceeds to purchase the deceased’s share of the company.</p>

    <h3>Sale of the share in the company by the deceased’s personal representatives</h3>
    <h4>Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</h4>
    <p>The proceeds from the sale of the share in the company <u>would be liable</u> to CGT in the hands of the personal representatives of the deceased. However a liability to tax would only arise on any increase in the value of the business from the date of death of the shareholder to the date of sale and, as such, is likely to be small. This time frame should be set out in the legal agreement.</p>
    
    <h4>Inheritance Tax</h4>
    <p>The value received for the deceased shareholders share in the business could give rise to an inheritance tax liability for the deceased’s estate. As they are selling the share in the business ‘Business Relief’ from Inheritance Tax will not apply.</p>
    <h4>IN ALL CASES PARTNERS SHOULD SEEK PROFESSIONAL LEGAL AND TAX ADVICE BEFORE PROCEEDING TO ASCERTAIN IF THE ARRANGEMENT IS LIKELY TO BE APPROPRIATE TO THEIR PERSONAL AND BUSINESS CIRCUMSTANCES.</h4>

    <strong>Revenue Clarification on Taxation of Shareholder Protection Insurance</strong>
    <strong>Policies written under trust.</strong>
    <p>The following is an extract of a letter written by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners (Capital Taxes Branch) to the Irish Insurance Federation in June 1992:</p>
    <strong>Re: Shareholder Protection Assurance</strong>
    <p><i>"Essentially we are dealing here with policies which are effected purely for commercial purposes and agreed between the individual partners/shareholders on an arms length basis without any intention to make a gift.</i></p>
     <p><i>The Revenue approach to such policies, written in the form of own life in trust for others, is to treat the proceeds as exempt from Inheritance Tax in the following circumstances: -</i></p>
     <p><i>(i) Proceeds on death will be used to purchase deceased's shareholding.  Any surplus arising will be liable to Inheritance Tax.</i></p>
     <p><i>(ii) The capital sum under each policy will reflect the policyholder's shareholding.</i></p>
     <p><i>(iii) Payment of premiums will be made by the individual members or on their behalf by the company or partnership out of the individual's own company or partnership account.</i></p>
      <p><i>(iv) New partner(s)/shareholder(s) can join the arrangement at any time, subject to the conditions applicable to the existing members of the plan.</i></p>
     <p><i>(v) On withdrawal from the company or on retirement, the policy of the partner who leaves will revert to himself and he will no longer benefit in the continuing arrangement, provided he sells his shareholding on withdrawal, otherwise he can remain a party to the arrangement.  Such policy will be an asset in his estate on his death and will not be exempt from Inheritance Tax.</i></p>
     <p><i>(vi) On the death of a sole surviving partner or shareholder the policy on his life will be an asset in his estate and will not be exempt from Inheritance Tax.  Similarly, if a partnership breaks up or a company is wound up, policies, which do not lapse, will be liable on death to Inheritance Tax.</i></p>
     <p><i>(vii) Where a partner refuses to join the arrangement or is unable to effect life insurance on medical grounds, then he will be precluded from benefiting from the policies of his co-shareholders.</i></p>
     <p><i>(viii) The insurance policies can either be Term Insurance, Endowment or Whole of Life policies, with the Death Benefit only passing to the surviving shareholders.</i></p>
     <p><i>(ix) Company Directors/Partnership Insurance using Own Life in Trust must be supported	by relevant documentation:</i></p>
     <p><i>(a)	Buy/Sell (or Double Option) Agreement.</i></p>
     <p><i>(b)	Reciprocal Agreement.</i></p>
     <p><i>(c)	Trust Document.</i></p>




    <p><strong>IN ALL CASES SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD SEEK PROFESSIONAL LEGAL AND TAX ADVICE BEFORE PROCEEDING TO ASCERTAIN IF THE ARRANGEMENT IS LIKELY TO BE APPROPRIATE TO THEIR PERSONAL AND CORPORATE CIRCUMSTANCES</strong></p>
