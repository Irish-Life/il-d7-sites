            "text": "Making investment decisions or financial decisions in general, can be quite difficult and may not be something you look forward to doing. You are a very cautious investor and don't like taking any financial risks. As a result, you prefer not to invest in assets that can go up and down in value for example, an investment property or shares, or any funds that invest in them. Safety is your main priority you would feel very uncomfortable with any investment that could cause you losses, even if it offers you a higher potential return. As a result, you will look for options that give you security and some certainty about the level of your return.",

            "text": "You are a very careful person, and you probably do not enjoy making investment decisions. You will tend to focus firstly on ways to limit or, if possible, remove the risks on your investments before you think about the growth opportunities. As a result, you are unlikely to own, or have owned, assets that can go up and down in value for example, an investment property or shares, or any funds that invest in them. If you were making a lump-sum investment, you would look for options that give you protection but you would not need a specific level of return. If there is a way to increase the growth of your investment, you will consider it once your capital is secure. When it comes to making regular savings or funding your pension, you will look for options that give low levels of ups and downs over the long term in return for a better potential return.",

You are not intimidated by making investment decisions although it may not be an area that you take a very active interest in. You may have some experience of investing some of your money in assets for example, managed funds that can go up and down in value to a small degree. If you were making a lump-sum investment, you would be willing to accept a low level of ups and downs to improve your chances of getting a better return than deposit accounts tend to give. For example, you may want some of your money invested in a capital secure option, but would be willing to take some risk with the rest to get a higher return. When it comes to making regular savings, or funding your pension, you will look to control the ups and downs over the long term in return for a good potential return.",
