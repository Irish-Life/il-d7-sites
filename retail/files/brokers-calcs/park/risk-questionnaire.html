<div id="importantInformation"><h1>Your Attitude to Risk</h1>
<h3>Please read this important information before you answer the questions</h3>
<p>The attached application has been developed as a suggested set of questions and answers which may help you decide the type of risk you are willing to accept before you decide to save or invest.</p>
<p>Everyone can have a different attitude to risking their money at different times in their lives. There is no single perfect method for assessing this and it can never be a substitute for meeting a Financial Advisor to do a detailed fact-find which would look at all aspects of your financial situation and needs.</p>
<p>This questionnaire only measures your willingness to take risk; it does not take your ability to take risk into account. This application should not be relied on for any investment or retirement planning decisions you make.</p>
<p>The general results offered by the application are designed for an investor with a 7-10 year time horizon and are not intended to constitute investment advice or recommendations regarding investment or retirement planning for you. They may help with assessing your general attitude to risk, which is only one aspect of overall financial advice.</p>
<p>Please contact your Financial Advisor if you wish to get more information on your financial planning options.</p>

<p>Making investment decisions or financial decisions in general can be quite difficult and may not be something you look forward to doing. You are a very cautious investor and do not like taking financial risks. As a result, you may not like investing in assets that can go up and down in value, for example an investment property or shares.</p>
<p>For retirement planning however, because there is a risk that future inflation may reduce the purchasing power of your fund at retirement, you realise that there are advantages to investing in more risky assets that may go up and down in value, for example shares and property. This is because the potential for growth is higher than for safer assets such as cash.</p>
<h4>Your approach to savings and investments</h4>
<p>When it comes to lump sum investments and regular savings, safety is your main priority and you would feel very uncomfortable with any investment that could cause you losses, even if it offers you a higher potential return. As a result, you will look for options that give you security and some certainty about the level of your return.</p>
</div><div class="clearer"> </div><h4>Your approach to saving for retirement</h4>
<p>When it comes to funding your pension, you recognise that having a 'safe' approach to investment could mean that the performance of the pension fund may not beat inflation over the longer term and that a more risky approach is necessary to cope with this. You accept that with this approach comes the risk of your fund value going up and down over the term of the plan. If you are not happy with this investment approach, a low-risk cash fund is available which reduces the risk of these ups and downs over the term of your pension plan. You should be aware that this approach greatly reduces the potential for growth and increases the risk that inflation may erode the value of your pension fund. You should discuss these options with your financial adviser.</p>
<p>It is important that you review this to ensure this is an accurate reflection of your attitude to risk.</p>

<p>You are a careful person, and you probably do not enjoy making investment decisions. You will tend to focus firstly on ways to limit the risks on your investments before you think about the growth opportunities.</p>
<p>For retirement planning however, because there is a risk that future inflation may reduce the purchasing power of your fund at retirement, you realise that there are advantages to investing in more risky assets that may go up and down in value, for example, shares and property. This is because the potential for growth is higher than for safer assets such as cash.</p>
<h4>Your approach to lump sum investments</h4>
<p>If you were making a lump-sum investment, you would only be willing to accept low levels of ups and downs and you are happy to sacrifice growth opportunities to reduce these potential ups and downs. You will consider investments with a low potential for loss, but this allows you to consider investments with growth potential ahead of traditional cash or deposit investments.</p>
</div><div class="clearer"> </div><h4>Your approach to regular savings</h4>
<p>When it comes to making regular savings you will look for options that give low levels of ups and downs over the long term in return for a better potential return. You understand that regular savings allow you invest in a manner that reduces the timing risk of investing in financial markets. Regular savings allow you buy more units when markets are low and buy less units when markets are more expensive. As a regular saver you take a medium to long-term view, allowing you take slightly more risk than you would with a once-off lump sum investment.</p>
<h4>Your approach to saving for retirement</h4>
<p>When it comes to funding your pension, you recognise that having a ‘careful’ approach to investment could mean that the performance of the pension fund may not beat inflation over the longer term and that a more risky approach is necessary to cope with this. You accept that with this approach comes the risk of your fund value going up and down over the term of the plan. If you are not happy with this investment approach, a low-risk cash fund is available which reduces the risk of these ups and downs over the term of your pension plan.

<p>You are a medium risk profile investor with a tendency to lean towards taking a cautious approach. When it comes to investments, you are willing to venture a little to get the opportunity for a better reward. You are not intimidated by making investment decisions although it may not be an area that you take a very active interest in. You may have some experience of investing some of your money in assets, for example managed funds that can go up and down in value.</p>
<h4>Your approach to lump sum investments</h4>
<p>If you were making a lump-sum investment, you would be willing to accept a low to medium levels of ups and downs to improve your chances of getting a better return than deposit accounts tend to give.</p>

<h4>Your approach to saving for retirement</h4>
<p>You recognise that over the long term, it is necessary to invest in assets like bonds, shares and property if you want your pension to have a good chance of providing a good potential return in the long term. When it comes to planning for your retirement you will accept a medium amount of ups and downs in return for a good potential return.</p>
<p>It is important that you review this to ensure this is an accurate reflection of your attitude to risk.</p>

When it comes to making regular savings or funding your pension, you are looking for good growth potential over the long term and so you are willing to accept quite significant ups and downs along the way.</p>

The asset class mixes are based on an investor with a 7-10 year time horizon making a once-off investment. The asset class mixes are not made with a regular saver or pension investor in mind. The above asset class mix is not a recommendation, and does not take into account any specific circumstances, goals, objectives, needs, age, or other aspects which make up full financial advice.<br /><br />
Also, it cannot take into account any individual's current investment portfolio. Irish Life provides a wide range of funds, offering access to a variety of asset classes, to deal with all types of investment needs. In our product literature we will always seek to set out as much detail as possible on the nature of our funds, their risk level, and volatility. This is to help both financial advisers and customers to identify funds which may match particular risk attitudes (in a general way).<br /><br />
You need to be comfortable that the level of risk you may take suits your circumstances. This application can be no more than a useful general guide to which asset classes might be suitable for you (as part of an overall portfolio approach to investment). Please contact your Financial Adviser if you wish to get more information on your financial planning options.</p>
