		<h3>Explore Irish Life MAPS</h3>
	  </header>	
	 <div class="modal-body">
		<p>Irish Life MAPS are our range of five multi-asset portfolio funds, available on our investment plans. They were launched in May 2013 and since then more than 45,000 people have invested over €2.6 billion.<br/><br/>
		Each of the Irish Life Multi Asset Portfolio Funds (MAPS) has been developed to suit different attitudes to risk. These range from lower risk, Multi Asset Portfolio 2 (MAP2), which has a large percentage invested in cash and bonds to higher risk Multi Asset Portfolio 6 (MAP6), which is mainly invested in shares.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		As the name suggests, each fund is multi-asset - investing in shares, bonds, cash and alternatives. Each fund uses the unique Dynamic Share to Cash model (DSC).

		Each of the Irish Life Multi Asset Portfolio Funds (MAPS) has been developed to suit different attitudes to risk. These range from lower risk, Multi Asset Portfolio 2 (MAP2), which has a large percentage invested in cash and bonds to higher risk Multi Asset Portfolio 6 (MAP6), which is mainly invested in shares.<br/><br/>
		<strong>Managing risk to stay on track</strong>
		<br/>
		Our Investment Managers manage each MAPS fund to the stated level of risk, using processes like quarterly rebalancing and the Dynamic Share to Cash (DSC) model.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Dynamic Share to Cash (DSC)</strong>
		<br/>
		The Dynamic Share to Cash model is used on all five Multi Asset Portfolio Funds. This innovative model uses a multi-factor approach to identifying long-term stock market trends and movements.
		The advantage of having the DSC is that it aims to reduce the amount invested in Global Shares and increase the amount in cash when it identifies greater potential for stock market falls. As importantly, when the DSC identifies greater potential for stock market recovery, it will move back out of cash and into Global Shares.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		This innovative solution is a market first in Ireland and our Investment Managers have spent two years developing and testing this model. It is important to note that the DSC looks at long-term movements and trends in the market and is not designed to react to one-off or short-term jumps or shocks. Also, currently DSC applies to Global Shares, though our Investment Managers will continually review this and, in the future, a similar process may apply to other assets.

		<h3>5 key tips to find the right investment for you</h3>
	  </header>
	  <div class="modal-body">
		<p>
		<strong>1. Know what are your financial goals are first.</strong>
		<br/>
		Put simply, why are you investing? What do you hope to achieve and is there a particular date or time when you want to access your money?
		<br/>
		<br/>
		For example, if you know you’ll need to access your money within the short term – say you’ll need it in 2 or 3 years’ time, then something like a fixed term deposit may be the best option.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		However, if you’ve got a longer time-frame, or no specific time-frame in mind, then investing may be the best choice to get your money working harder for you. The longer you invest the better the returns tend to be.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>2. Know what type of investor you are and the kind of investment you’re most comfortable with.</strong>
		<br/>
		Simply check our Investor Profiler. By answering some straight-forward questions you’ll learn what type of investor you are and what type of investment is the best match for your needs. 
        <br/>
		<br/>
		Low risk options tend to have limited potential returns, whereas taking some balanced and well-controlled risk could give you the opportunity to generate a better return over the longer term.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>3. Know the range of returns you can expect to get</strong>
		<br/>
		Investing is a great way to make your money work harder. However, all investments carry some element of risk. The good news is that there are many different types of investments – ones with lower risk and lower potential returns, right through to those with higher risk and higher potential returns. 
        <br/>
		<br/>
		<a style="color:black" href="https://www.irishlife.ie/investments/irish-life-maps"><em>Find out more on Irish Life MAPS and the range of returns to expect for different types of funds.</em></a>
		<br/>
		<br/>		
		<strong>4. Don’t put all your investment eggs in one basket</strong>
		<br/>
		When investing it’s also wise to consider your exposure to potential changes in the marketplace and what that might mean for your investment. This is why it can be a good idea to spread investments across many different assets, lowering your risk of exposure to market changes. This means you’re not overly reliant on the performance of any one asset.
        <br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>5. Know who is taking care of your investment and what their track record is like</strong>
        <br/>		
		Regardless of who you choose to invest with, the top priority should be ensuring that your funds are managed by experienced Investment Managers with a proven track record. For example, with Irish Life MAPS®, these funds are managed overall by our multi award-winning Investment Managers and part of the funds are invested by world class Investments Specialists chosen by us. We have more than 75 years expertise in helping people plan their finances and our Investment Managers now take care of over €65 billion of investments.
