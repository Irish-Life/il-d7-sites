    <u>INFORMATION ON FUND AND FUND VALUES </u>
</h2>

<p>Through 'irishlife.ie' you can see information about the funds and fund values given to the plan. We give this information
    in line with the qualifications (for example, switch pending) shown on the 'irishlife.ie' website at the time of viewing.</p>
<p>The value of the investments may fall as well as rise. As a result, there is no guarantee that the value shown will be accurate
    at the time you view it. We provide these values for information purposes only so that you can track the value of the
    plan. You should not use the values to base any investment decision on.</p>
<h2>
    <u>SWITCHING BETWEEN FUNDS </u>
</h2>

<p>Through 'irishlife.ie' you can give us instructions on-line for switching some or all of the money invested in a plan from
    one fund to another. The terms governing switching in the Plan terms also apply to this type of switching in 'irishlife.ie'.</p>
<p>You irrevocably authorize us to act on all switching instructions we receive through 'irishlife.ie' through or under your
    User ID or any other personal security details without us taking any further steps to check them. Our authority to act
    will continue until we receive a notice that the plan is being assigned (transferred) or that a trust has been created
    over the plan.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about transactions related to your plans, you should contact us immediately.</p>
<p>However, for joint-life or dual-life plans, in your application form you may have chosen an option relating to 'alteration
    authority'. If so, and you chose that only one plan owner or both plan owners have to make alterations, you will not
    be allowed to switch on-line. You will be able to access the value section. If you choose either plan owner as being
    able to make alterations, you will have the option to switch on-line.</p>
<p>Also, our authority to act will continue until we receive a notice that the plan is being transferred or that a trust has
    been created over the plan. You agree to be jointly and severally liable with all other people with whom you jointly
    own the plan for all liabilities and loss arising from any switching instructions you give under the On-Line Service
    terms.
</p>
<p>You acknowledge that:</p>
<ul class="browser-default">
    <li>switching instructions can only be effective from the time we receive them; and</li>
    <li>there may be delays from the moment of sending switching instructions over the internet and us receiving them.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we receive a properly carried-out switch instruction, an automatic receipt confirmation of the switch instruction will
    be displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>The investment prices we use for your switch will be the next available fund price.</p>
<p>We do not charge for this service currently but we reserve the right to charge for this service in the future.</p>
<p>Once we have carried out the switch, we will send you confirmation by post to the most up to date record of your address
    on our systems.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of property investments, a notice period may be required if you want to cash in or switch property investments.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to amend at any time the rules governing this service. We reserve the right to withdraw this service
    in its entirety without prior notice.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to withdraw this service without prior notice and without explanation from particular individuals who
