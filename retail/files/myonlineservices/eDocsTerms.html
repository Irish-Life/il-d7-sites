        agreeing to return to receiving hard copy, paper based documents.</p>

    <h3>
        HOW eDOCUMENTS WORKS</h3>
    <p>
        When you sign up a Plan for the eDocuments Service, we stop sending you hard copy,
        paper based documents via post. Instead, we store your documents in the Electronic
        Mailbox and we allow you to view them via irishlife.ie.</p>
    <p>
        Every time an eDocument is produced we will send you an email and SMS Alert to notify
        you that a new eDocument has been added to the Electronic Mailbox for you to view
        via irishlife.ie.</p>
    <p>
        You can update your email address and mobile number through irishlife.ie. You accept
        that you are responsible for ensuring that both your email address and phone number
        are kept accurate and up-to-date. You warrant that these and all other information
        given to us for the purposes of or in connection with the eDocuments Service are
        complete, accurate and up-to-date at all relevant times and you undertake to promptly
        notify us of any changes to such information.</p>
    <p>
        You undertake to verify the correctness of each eDocument which contains a notice
        to you in relation to any potential discrepancies, omissions or inaccuracies contained
        in it. If no objection is made by you within 30 days, the same shall be evidence
        without any further proof that the eDocument is correct and we shall be free from
        all claims in relation to it.</p>

    <h3 class="wider">
        SECURITY</h3>
    <p>
        You agree to keep your chosen User Id and any other personal security details secure and confidential
        at all times and take all reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorised or fraudulent
        use of such.</p>
    <p>
        You acknowledge that you should change your personal security details from time
        to time to guard against unauthorised or fraudulent access to the eDocuments Service.</p>
    <p>
        You should never respond to a request purportedly from us to provide your User Id and
        any other personal security details as we will never make such a request.</p>
    <p>
        Your use and storage of any information, including your User Id and any other personal security
        details, transaction or any other information is at your own risk and is your sole

    <p>
        You accept that neither you nor we are guaranteed absolute security in relation
        to the eDocuments Service.</p>
    <p>
        Your End-user Device is part of the delivery of the eDocuments Service. However,
        this is outside our control and can become a security risk. Despite our security
        measures, we cannot accept responsibility for your End-user Device. You acknowledge
        the following in particular that:</p>
    <ul class="normal">
        <li>Insufficient familiarity with the system and lack of security precautions on the
            End-user Device can make unauthorised access easier (e.g. saving data with insufficient
            protection on hard drives, file transfers, information left on the screen, etc.).
            You are responsible for obtaining information on the necessary security precautions.</li>
        <li>It is impossible to rule out the possibility that your behaviour may be profiled
            by a network provider (e.g. internet service provider, SMS provider), i.e. the network
            provider can infer when and with whom you make contact.</li>
        <li>There is a risk that a third party may gain undetected access to the computer while
            the eDocuments Service is being used.</li>
        <li>Technology risks (such as viruses or destructive codes) may spread to your End-user
            Device when it connects to an external server for a network session (e.g. the internet,
            SMS). Appropriate security software that is available in the market can help you
            take the necessary security precautions. You understand that connection to an external
            server for a network session involves the risk of possible unauthorised alteration
            or usage of eDocuments. You understand, acknowledge and confirm that connection
            to an external server for a network session is susceptible to fraud, misuse, hacking
            and other actions to that effect. You agree to exempt us from any and all responsibility/liability
            arising from such misuse.</li>
        <li>You should only install software that has been obtained from reliable sources.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You agree that you are aware of the risk of the content of your eDocuments becoming
        known to third parties and you agree that you shall not hold us responsible for
        same and that same shall not be considered as a breach by us of any data protection
        or confidentiality obligations.</p>
    <p>
        You must inform us immediately if any irishlife.ie Website hyperlinks appear to be
        irregular or if your User Id or any other personal security details are compromised.</p>
    <p>
        Neither we, any of our affiliates, nor any telecommunications companies designated
        by us (if any) for the purposes of providing the eDocuments Service shall assume
        any liability or responsibility for the consequences arising from any cause beyond
        our reasonable control, including, without limitation, failure of your End-user
        Device or any other telecommunications equipment to receive the eDocuments for whatever
        reason, any telecommunications breakdown, mechanical failure, path failure, malfunction,
        technical breakdown, interruption or accuracy of equipment or installation.</p>
    <p>
        You are responsible for the security of your End-user Device and must take all reasonable
        precautions to prevent anyone else from accessing it or any confidential information
        stored or accessible on it.</p>
    <p>

        or otherwise affect our provision or your use of the eDocuments Service.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>
        The third parties supporting the eDocuments Service (including telecommunications
        companies designated by us) are neither agencies of us nor representing us. There

        MISCELLANEOUS</h3>
    <p>
        If we fail, at any time, to insist upon strict performance of any of your obligations
        under the Terms and Conditions, or if we fail to exercise any of the rights or remedies
        to which we are entitled under the Terms and Conditions, this will not constitute
        a waiver of such rights or remedies and will not relieve you from compliance with
        such obligations. A waiver by us of any default will not constitute a waiver of
        any subsequent default.</p>
    <p>
        If any court or competent authority decides that any of the provisions of the Terms
        and Conditions are invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, the term will,
        to that extent only, be severed from the remaining terms, which will continue to
        be valid to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>

        We intend to rely upon the Terms and Conditions in relation to your use of the eDocuments

        Irish law applies to the Terms and Conditions and the Irish courts are the only
        ones that have jurisdiction over any claims or disputes arising out of or in connection
        with the Terms and Conditions.</p>
