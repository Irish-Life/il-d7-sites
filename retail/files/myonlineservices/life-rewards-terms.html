            Life Rewards is a
            permission-based loyalty &amp; reward programme. It is open and available all Irish
            Life customers aged 18 years or over, resident in the Republic of Ireland. To
            register for Life Rewards a valid Irish Life policy number is required. Where
            there is more than one person on a policy the one policy number is valid for
            all members on that policy. Only one login and password will be required for
            each policy. All members on that policy should share login details in this
            instance.

            The term 'offers' will refer
            to all discount offers from partners of Irish Life who have agreed to
            participate in the Life Rewards Loyalty programme.

        </p>

        <p>

            By registering and availing of
            any Life Rewards offer you also agree to any terms and conditions of our
            Partners in relation to the 'offers'. There may be some conditions or
            limitations on the redemption or use of an 'offer' you should therefore read
            all terms and conditions carefully. If you do not comply with the terms and
            conditions you may not be able to avail fully or at all.

        </p>

        <p>

            Offers on the Life Rewards
            programme will be updated regularly and may change, therefore you should keep
            up to date with your Irish Life Online Service for updates. Unfortunately,
            offers cannot be kept up indefinitely, they will only be valid for a limited
            time and will expire so please ensure you make any redemptions on time. Irish
            Life will not be responsible if a redeemed offer is incomplete, lost or not
            received.

        </p>

        <p>

            There may be a number of ways
            to redeem a Life Rewards offer and these might be subject to certain
            conditions, we will set these out on our website or set out by our offer
            partners.
