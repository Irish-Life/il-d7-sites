<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since 2008, Irish Life has embarked on an Operational Excellence programme. The purpose of the programme was to train staff to improve the way that we work for the benefit of our Customer. Team members have received <em>Lean Six Sigma</em> training which originally evolved from the Manufacturing industry. <em>Lean Six Sigma</em>, due to its success, has spread across all Industries and is adopted by most major companies across the world.

At present we have in excess of 200 members of staff trained to one of 3 levels. These levels are ranked in belts just like martial arts; Black Belts, Green Belts &amp; Yellow Belts. The Belts relate to the level of training received and therefore projects are allocated to each level based on their complexity.

Each trained staff member has delivered a project that improves service to our customers. Some examples have been improving the telephony service to our contact centre so that you, our customer, get to speak to someone who has expertise in resolving your particular enquiry. Other examples have been speeding up payments when cashing in or claiming on a plan. Where possible we now use Electronic Funds Transfer which removes the need for our customers to take time out to lodge cheques to their own bank accounts. Through these projects we have also improved our application forms. Questions have been revisited, reviewed and where possible removed to make the application process less time consuming and more straight forward.

Our aim is to have every team member trained in <em>Lean Six Sigma</em> and to deliver improvement projects. We have huge amounts of information to help us with this. Every call or online request is logged and from this we can identify where further improvements can be made. As our training explains, no process is perfect and we will continually improve what we do for the benefit our customers.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi John,

What Martin is referring to here is our use of Electronic Fund transfer to "pay out" on our policies. So for instance if you had a savings account with us, and wished to withdraw, we would simply transfer the funds to your account, instead of sending you a cheque. The information you received regarding our use of direct debit is correct, this is our primary method of accepting your monthly premiums into a plan. However, we do accept one off payments by laser on some policies at no extra cost.]]></wp:comment_content>

<h2>Sovereign Concerns are now spreading from the Eurozone to the US.</h2>
Monday 13th December Ruth Cooney is markets economist with Irish Life Investment Managers

</div>
<div id="articleMain">
<h4>SUMMARY: The US Government announced a fresh economic stimulus plan that if passed the deficit to GDP in the US could be maintained between 9-10% next year. The UK responds with a similar plan</h4>
The yield on the ten year US government bond increased last week from 2.95% to 3.33% and up from its low of 2.4% at the start of October. These moves come after the US government announced a fresh economic stimulus plan, a sharp contrast to the approach of fiscal austerity taken by both countries in the Eurozone and in the UK. It is thought that if this plan is passed then the deficit to GDP in the US could be maintained between 9-10% next year, according to the Financial Times.

In December 2009, credit rating agency Moody’s published a report that the UK and the US must prove they could reduce their deficits to avoid the threat to their triple A credit rating. Although it is doubtful whether a threat to the US’ triple A status is conceivable, the rating agencies are highlighting that there are increased risks for the traditional “risk-free assets”.

The UK has responded to this report during 2010 and has proactively put a clearly defined plan in place on how it will bring its deficit to GDP, which was 11.5% in 2009, back to a more manageable level in the future. However last week the Obama administration and the Congressional Republicans agreed to continued to spend. They have agreed to extend the tax cuts and unemployment benefits that were set to expire at the end of 2010, as well as the payroll holiday tax and tax breaks for investments. This package is significantly larger than had been expected and has resulted in the sharp sell off in triple A government bonds of UK, US and Germany over the past week, or as the chart below shows a significant rise in ten year government bond yields.

<strong>Triple A Government Bond Yields Spiked last week (ten year government bond yield in Germany, UK &amp; US)</strong>

<strong><img src="http://www.irishlife.ie/uploadedImages/Triple%20A%20Government%20Bond%20Yields.bmp" alt="" /></strong>

<strong>Rare but not unique in a historical context</strong>

Moody’s responded to the extension of the tax cuts by noting that the stable outlook for the US triple A credit rating would not be impacted immediately by the latest fiscal stimulus. But the agency noted that the tax cuts were extended beyond the proposed two year time frame and hence “clearly makes the longer term outlook more negative”.

In contrast to the concerns about fiscal sustainability for many of the advanced countries in the world, policy makers in the US could look towards Japan. Policy makers in Japan have maintained a loose fiscal policy over the past twenty years and government bond yields in Japan are the lowest in the world, despite its debt to GDP ratio of over 200%. The increased supply in Japan has been met by solid demand for Japanese bonds from domestic investors. The high savings ratio in Japan has ensured that the increased supply of Japanese bonds has been met by strong domestic demand, which has kept yields higher. However this higher savings ratio has been offset but much weaker domestic demand and the economy has become highly reliant on exports for economic growth.

To date, demand for US government bonds has remained, even last week the 30 year bond auction in the US was 2.79 times covered, despite the sell off seen in treasuries. It is well known that China has been a large buyer of US treasuries, so much so that a sharp decline in the value of US treasuries would have a significant impact on China. However there are some signs that demand is declining, especially from foreign investors according to the latest inflow data. Further signs of waning demand for government bonds were evident by investors pulling their money from Pimco’s Total Return Fund, the world’s largest mutual fund through November. It was reported by Morningstar that the fund experienced net withdrawals for the first time in two years as investors redeemed $1.9bln from the fund.

Elsewhere the Federal Reserve is currently a strong buyer of US government bonds, albeit in the secondary market, through its $600bln quantitative easing programme. A decrease of demand from foreign investors is a major concern for US policy makers. The Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing is only a temporary fix. Increased demand from domestic savers would help, although this could be at the expense of an economic recovery as increased savings would have a negative impact on consumption. The moves in bond markets over the past week are signalling to US policy makers that investors, particularly foreign investors are not as willing to fund the continued overspending by the US government. Hence a change in the policy stance may be necessary before the situation becomes unmanageable.

<title>A look at Market Returns for 2010</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[2010 will not only be remembered for the year that the Tipperary hurlers brought a halt to Kilkenny’s five in a row dream, but also as the year that the Eurozone sovereign crisis unravelled. However neither event was big enough to derail the equity market rally that started in March 2009, although the latter was responsible in creating much volatility for equity, bond and currency markets.

2010 was a year of sharp contrasts for investors, with great rewards for players who managed to be on the right side. Examples include fears of a double dip recession in the developed world versus the strong growth in the emerging economies, concerns about the over indebted governments and consumers compared to the cash rich corporations, record low bond yields in triple A countries versus high yields in the peripheral Eurozone countries such as Greece and Ireland. Finally the fiscal austerity measures being adopted across Europe compared to the unprecedented government and central bank stimulus put in place in the US.

<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Market-Returns-2010.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-149" title="Market Returns 2010" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Market-Returns-2010.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="444" /></a>

<strong>A re-rating of the risk free asset class</strong>

The sovereign debt crisis which first emerged in January 2010 when it became evident that the fiscal situation in Greece was unsustainable. This crisis led to a reconsideration of safe assets as the risk of default is now being priced into what traditionally have been the one of the safest asset classes’ government bonds. Going into 2011 it is likely that the re-rating of safety is likely to continue as the rating agencies have signalled Greece, Portugal and possibly Spain are faced with further downgrades, while there are also rumblings that the “ultimate safe haven”- US Government Bonds could be put on review for a potential downgrade. Hence as the risk of default was priced into bond markets the appetite for the bonds of riskier countries declined. The danger is that as the number of “risky” countries increases that bailouts are less feasible. On the other hand, the credit risk attached to companies is easing, particularly as the balance sheets are very healthy but also as companies are much more mobile and have the ability to get exposure to countries with robust growth. As a result the spread between government bonds and corporate bonds has declined through 2010 and corporate bonds outperformed conventional government bonds.

<strong>Benign and uneven economic recovery</strong>

Expectations for the recovery in the US also deteriorated during the year, particularly as leading indicators peaked and have eased since the start of the year. Elsewhere, the recovery to date in the US has been jobless as the unemployment rate remained close to its peak at 9.8%. The negative economic data, during the year weighed on markets. However, in November and December policy makers in the US have stepped up as the Federal Reserve announced it will buy as much as $600bln government bonds and the US government announced an extension of the tax cuts and additional stimulus to business. This additional stimulus has boosted the outlook of the US economy for 2011 going into the year end; however concerns are also mounting about the sustainability of US government’s deficit.

<strong>The returns for equity markets have been supported by earnings growth</strong>

Earnings expectations for 2010 in both Europe and the US are set to come in well ahead of expectations. In January 2010 analyst were expecting that earnings for the S&amp;P 500 would grow by 26% however at the end of December expectations had increased to 42% growth, while in Europe expectations have increased from 25% growth to 35%. The improvement has been driven by increased cost cutting, particularly in the US as well as double digit earnings growth from companies that have exposure to emerging markets. These measures have offset the sluggish low single digit revenue growth that has been experienced from developed countries.

<strong>Emerging Markets outperformed Developed Markets</strong>

Both emerging market debt and equities saw strong money flow as the outlook for the emerging economies continued to improve and investors sought to get exposure to companies, government bonds and the currencies of these regions. The emerging economies have continued to expand beyond the emerging Asian region as Latin America and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region are also seen as attractive. The continued expansion of the middle classes in these regions is expected to drive growth in these countries over the next few years. The latest concerns for these regions are that they will over heat, particularly as food inflation, which has a much higher impact on consumer price basket in emerging regions than it would be in the developed economies, has been rising.

<strong>What about 2011?</strong>

Going into 2011 it is hard to believe that the sovereign concerns that started in 2010 are going away, if anything it is likely that these concerns will intensify early in the new year as countries attempt to front load the new debt issuance during the first quarter. This also with the treat of further downgrades by the rating agencies will lead to continued volatility for both bond and equity markets. Despite this, continued strong earnings, supportive valuations and robust corporate balance sheets are likely to support equity markets during 2011.

<title>Another good year for global equity markets</title>
<link>http://blog.irishlife.ie/infocus-market-updates/another-good-year-for-global-equity-markets/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year proved to be a reasonably good year for equities and the prospects for 2011 look positive. On a global basis equities, as measured by the FTSE World index, rose by 10.7% in local currency terms. And thanks to the general weakness of the euro last year, the return in euro terms was an even more impressive 20.6%. Most regions across the globe exhibited strong returns but Euroarea equities only produced a return of 3.2% as measured by the FTSE Euroarea index. The Irish market also had a disappointing year as it fell by 0.8% in 2010.

It was really in the last quarter of 2010 that global equity markets recovered their mojo as a combination of strong earnings numbers, improving economies and the continuation of lax monetary and fiscal policies drove markets higher. The prospects for the global economy appeared to improve as 2010 progressed, as emerging markets continued to perform strongly and the U.S. economy benefited from the aggressive policy actions of both the Federal Reserve and the fiscal authorities. Elsewhere, the recoveries in Germany and Japan were also stronger than expected. Company earnings grew strongly last year as it is estimated that the earnings of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 in the U.S. grew by over 40%.

<strong>Constructive on global equities for a number of reasons</strong>
<ol>
<li>In general, we are constructive on global equities in 2011 based on a number of reasons:We expect that the global economy will continue to grow this year, exhibiting solid growth in the region of 4.5%. The IMF forecasts that global growth will average around 4.5% over the next four to five years, with emerging economies being the key driver of growth.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/imfforecastsforgdpgrowth.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164" title="IMF forecasts for GDP growth" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/imfforecastsforgdpgrowth.png" alt="IMF forecasts for GDP growth" width="550" height="340" /></a></li>
<li>Monetary and fiscal policy is expected to remain very supportive for the most of 2011.</li>
<li>Valuations, while not distinctly cheap, are below long-term averages and should prove supportive in the coming 12-months. The fact that earnings growth outstripped the growth in prices in 2010 saw the price/earnings ratio of many markets contract in 2010 and are now below their long-term averages. Furthermore, the dividend yields offered by many equity markets across the globe are now as attractive as the yield on ten-year government bonds markets in the major developed markets. The following table provides a good summary of key valuation metrics of global equity markets and in general, the markets look reasonably priced whether from a price to earnings (P/E) perspective or from a yield perspective.</li>

<li>The risk of deflation appears to be receding and thus should see some element of pricing power returning to companies, particularly those with strong franchises. Commodity prices have started to rumble again last year, especially non-cyclical ones such as gold and agriculture commodities. However, there does appear to be something of a shift towards more economically sensitive commodities such as copper and oil. Consequently, with rising commodity prices, the danger of deflation does appear to be receding.</li>
</ol>
We are particularly disposed to large cap quality equities. They have underperformed other, more riskier sectors of the markets such as small cap equities, technology companies and emerging market equities for example. Since early 2009, global equity markets have recovered impressively, but much of the out performance was concentrated in the aforementioned higher risk sectors.

<strong>But risks are evident</strong>

There are numerous risks in the global economy and the most pressing at the moment include the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and concerns about rising inflationary pressures. The fact that Europe has still failed to tackle the debt crisis in a fully planned and co-ordinated fashion means the markets will look to target individual countries and their respective bond markets. This backdrop will continue to unsettle equity markets on occasion this year. In terms of inflation, equity markets like a little but not too much. The general consensus is that inflation should be reasonably contained in 2011, but any unexpected surprises will raise the spectre of higher official rates at some stage during the year.

Despite this, continued strong earnings, supportive valuations and robust corporate balance sheets are likely to support equity markets during 2011.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[January at the best of times is never an easy month.

But in our current economic situation, we think families need all the help they can get with their personal finances.

<title>Irish commercial property – any light, any tunnel?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[After major repricing in 2008 and 2009, the commercial investment property market generated a low negative total return of c.-3% for 2010. The decline in capital values estimated at -11% was offset substantially by the income return at c.8%. Weak rental values were the major contributor to the fall in capital value with yields broadly remaining stable.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Performance of Irish Commercial Property</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Capital-Value-Drivers.png"></a><a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Capital-Value-Drivers.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-179" title="Capital Value Drivers" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Capital-Value-Drivers-1024x579.png" alt="" width="640" height="361" /></a></p>
While the level of repricing eased in 2010, the market continues to suffer from a lack of liquidity.  This is masking a number of issues.
<ul>
<li>2010 has seen the emergence of long term and opportunistic overseas investors, focussed on secure prime assets. This has generated a handful of deals, including a number on Grafton Street.</li>
<li>There is a level of domestic investor demand for smaller investments up to €5m, with a range of deals transacting, despite the general lack of availability of debt finance.</li>
<li>Market illiquidity is due in major part to a lack of sellers, with the slow rate of progress in NAMA loan transfers and business plan approval being a major contributor.</li>
<li>The IMF/ECB bailout has seen investor interest cool for the time being resulting in a number of substantial pipeline deals being put on hold, including the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre and the Royal Liver portfolio.</li>
</ul>
Occupier markets continue to remain challenging, with declining rental values the major contributor to recent capital value falls. In the retail sector landlords are accepting short term occupiers at discounted rents, however evidence is emerging of longer term letting deals (including Forever 21, Sketchers and Fat Face).

The vacancy rate in the Dublin office market remains stubbornly high at 23%. However take up has improved, albeit off a very low base, with 100,000 sq. m. let in aggregate (50% in the City Centre). New and expanding FDI companies (such as Google) are the main driver of activity, taking advantage of flexible lease terms and low rental levels.

Over the next number of years property returns are likely to be based on rental income return, which is currently running at 8%+ p.a. We anticipate some further declines in rental values in the first half of this year but anticipate that stability in rents should emerge in 2011. We expect some increase in investment transactions, with non NAMA banks generating sales. It is difficult to predict NAMA driven activity over the next 12 months - but their sales focus may well be on the UK rather than Ireland.

<strong>UK</strong><strong> Property Market – prime continuing to outperform</strong>

In terms of capital value growth 2010 was a year of continuous month on month growth. U.K. institutional investors were drawn into the market due to significant investor inflows, while overseas investors were primarily driven by the significant yield gap between bond yields and property yields and by a weak sterling. Since the trough of the market in July ’09 capital values have rallied by c.16% (6.5% in 2010), driving total returns of 13% for the year.

While the pace of capital value growth averaged at about 0.9% per month in H1’10, the pace declined in H2 to 0.2% on average. The ease in market re-pricing in H2 was due to weakening investor sentiment linked to a difficult economic backdrop and occupational market uncertainties. Investment was further curtailed due to a continued reduction in bank lending to the sector. In addition, with increasing speculation that banks will release distressed property for sale in 2011, investors adopted a ‘wait and see’ approach in the latter half of 2010.

2010 was also a year of divergence in the investor and occupational markets. Central London and key provincial cities were the preferred locations for investors and while occupational markets recovered in Central London, markets in the regions, burdened by excess supply and weakening demand, saw rents fall. Due to investors continuing to discount void risk, prime and secondary property markets continued to diverge. With limited supply of prime investments coming to the market and increasing demand prime yields continued to compress while secondary markets with limited demand and an over-supply saw values continue to fall.

In summary 2010 market trends would suggest that in the short term the market now appears to be entering a more difficult phase where yield compression gives way to some outward yield (fall in values) movement. Going forward into 2011 we believe property returns will be driven by income and it will be this income component that will keep total returns positive. Looking beyond 2011, and assuming no external economic shocks and the occupier market recovery broadens out across the whole market, we expect to see improved returns in 2012 and 2013.

The graphic below charts anticipated ‘all-property’ total return in the coming years as forecast by Capital Economics, Morgan Stanley (Derivatives) and the IPF Consensus.

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/All-property-total-returns-forecast.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-180" title="All property total returns forecast" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/All-property-total-returns-forecast-1024x542.png" alt="" width="640" height="338" /></a></p>
<strong>Euro Property Market – continuing to rebound in prime assets</strong>

A return to economic growth in H1 2010 and historic low bond yields led to a rebound in property prices in 2010, with risk adverse investors concentrating purely on prime assets in Western Europe. This demand for prime assets in core cities has created a polarised European property investment market with a significant divergence materialising between core, prime assets and peripheral secondary stock.

High prices for secure prime assets are a strong indicator of a lack of market confidence and that investors are in defensive mode looking for virtually risk free investments. In this climate, secondary assets in struggling economies such as Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain and parts of Central and Eastern Europe may face further value falls if their respective economies come under further pressure. It is for this reason that we expect that the focus on property investment going forward will be concentrated on France, Germany, the Nordics, UK, Austria, Benelux and Poland. While the pack will be hunting for super-safe investments there is an argument for investors to move up the risk curve and take on some leasing risk in good Western Centres and benefit from possible future tightening risk premiums. Ultimately, the decision to move away from super-safe property investments will come down to the investor’s belief that core European economies will remain robust.

In terms of outlook, it is likely that pricing of safe-haven core European government bonds will underpin continued strong investor interest in 2011. The major European commercial property markets have already passed through the bulk of a positive yield correction, although so far it has been limited to the narrow prime segment. In 2011, capital growth will be driven (in all sectors) by rental growth, albeit modestly, given near term mixed economic growth forecasts. The continuing weight of money ready to enter the market is expected to fuel further yield compression (value increases) and combined with income should deliver returns of 6% to 8%.  However, with the significant yield gap between prime and secondary remaining historically wide, and on the basis that the economic recovery continues, the most attractive opportunities may be found higher up the risk curve in management intensive assets, short leases and niche markets.

The graphic below charts anticipated ‘all-property’ weighted ungeared total returns in key ‘core’ markets in the coming years as forecast by Henderson Global Investors.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter" style="text-align: left;">Last weekend, the new refereeing season started.  2010 All Ireland Football Final Referee and Irish Life Assurance employee David Coldrick takes us through his 1st hectic weekend of the 2011 campaign.</div>
<strong>Friday evening, DCU – pre National Football League fitness test.</strong>

Bleeper test pass mark level 16.1, up from 15.6 a year earlier. This is only the level for the league. The pre championship level is likely to be around 17!   Because the test was so early in the year, I had to train over the Christmas &amp; New Year period and watch what I was eating and drinking. Getting onto the national league panel is serious business. If you don’t make the league panel, you won’t be eligible for the championship panel later in the year.

 I got to level 17.6 with Maurice Deegan. Felt this was enough for this time of year. One or two new guys got to 18.6 &amp; 19.1 – super running.

After the fitness test, the former English Premiership referee Dermot Gallagher spoke to the national referees group. He was very interesting, with lots of stories to tell. There were some serious points to take on board but what was striking was how similar our preparations were for games at the highest level in our respective codes. Premiership referees are professional but there is no doubt that the top gaelic football &amp; hurling referees are as professional in everything but name.

<strong>Saturday morning, Croke Park – annual rules test.</strong>

Pass mark 94%. I came out with 100%. No issues on knowledge of the rules. Interpretation is the key for all referees.

Remainder of the day was taken up by seminars on referees’ assessments at national level, nutrition &amp; training and a very lively session on video clips of incidents from last year’s football championship.

At national level, we now have this Turning Point technology, which is very similar to what was used by the audience on the <em>Who Wants To Be A Millionaire</em> television programme. Each referee gets a small device and for each clip, has to answer a/b/c/d on what the right action was to take on each incident shown. The potential actions range from free only to red card offence. Devices are matched to referees by serial number so it’s possible to know how each referee voted on each incident. This way a referee has to justify his decision if it runs contrary to the correct course of action as determined by the National Referees committee. I think this is a huge development in refereeing and will help to improve consistency among national referees going forward.   

<strong>Saturday evening, Croke Park – National Referees banquet.</strong>

I received my medal for refereeing last year’s All Ireland football final from the GAA president, Christy Cooney. It was a great night but again I had to be good as I was appointed to referee in the Leinster O’Byrne Cup the next day!

<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter" style="text-align: left;"> <strong>Sunday afternoon, Drogheda</strong></div>
Refereed the O’Byrne cup game between Louth &amp; Wicklow in Drogheda. After a long working week &amp; the efforts of the weekend, I found my first game of 2011 tough from a physical &amp; mental fitness point of view. I didn’t feel at my sharpest and blew up too quickly a few times when I really should have seen the advantage. No major issues, thankfully.

This post will be continued tomorrow]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[National League panel

The result of the weekend was the creation of the gaelic football &amp; hurling panels for the upcoming national football &amp; hurling leagues.

The football panel will consist of around 50 referees. Each referee will get 3 games during the league.   All games will be assessed by an independent assessor.  We start with a maximum score of 100 and the only way is down! We can lose marks on areas of technical fouls, aggressive fouls, umpiring &amp; teamwork, scores, control and fitness. It’s a wide ranging assessment and most referees wait with apprehension for their match assessment to arrive by email on the Tuesday/Wednesday post the game.  Mid to late 80s is a good match assessment!

After the league the national football panel will be reduced from 50 referees to a championship panel of 15-18. Your league assessment scores are what determine if you’re in or out. There’ll be another pre championship fitness test to pass in order to tick the final box for inclusion in the championship panel.

The slate is wiped clean at the start of each year and you have to prove yourself all over again. I might have refereed the All Ireland final last year but that counts for nothing in 2011. After passing both the league fitness &amp; rules tests, my only aim for the next few months is to referee to the best of my ability to get back on the championship panel for 2011 when it’s decided in late April this year.

I was supposed to have my first national league engagement on Feb 5<sup>th</sup> but the year-end valuation process and the long hours it involves meant that I had to withdraw. I didn’t want to pull out but I didn’t think that I’d be mentally sharp enough for a high profile inter-county game in 2 weeks time given my current work commitments. It can be difficult to balance my work &amp; refereeing commitments at this time in the year.

However hopefully it won’t be too long before I get my first appointment of the 2011 national league and that it’s just the start of another long and busy refereeing season.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Veni, Vidi, Vici.</h2>
I set off for Tanzania to take on Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in  Africa on 19th February.  Kilimanjaro, at 5895m (19,341ft) is the highest  mountain in Africa (and Europe).  It’s also the tallest freestanding mountain in  the world – meaning that it is not part of a range created by the shifting of  the earth’s plates, instead this is just one mother of a volcano, built from  millions of years of eruptions.  It’s not a technical ascent – no ropes or  scrambling to speak of – the real challenge for would-be climbers is the  altitude, which debilitates and sickens you from around half way up.  You can’t  really train for this, and I certainly had no idea as to how this would affect  me.
<blockquote>It’s not a technical ascent – no ropes or scrambling to speak of – the real challenge for would-be climbers is the altitude, which debilitates and sickens you from around half way up.</blockquote>
My day and a half long transit took me via Heathrow, Addis Ababa in Ethiopia,  Mombasa in Kenya and finally to Kilimanjaro airport in North East Tanzania.   Tanzania is a poor country by any standards.  There is a basic transport and  communication infrastructure developing, but most people where I saw lived a  subsistence agricultural based existence.  In spite of this they are a colourful  and striking people.  I spent the Saturday overnight in the idyllic Karama Lodge  in Arusha where I first met the other 13 souls on my trek party and our guides  Samuel (chief guide and super hero), Abel (very able) and Godbless (yes  really!).

The next day we were up early to get over the 3 hour bus journey around the  Kilimanjaro National park to the gate, where would begin our ascent up the  Marangu Route.  A hold up at park entry and the organising our luggage amongst  our army of porters meant we were delayed in starting, but finally we began  climbing at around 12.30pm.
<blockquote>On the first 4 days we were advised to consume over 5 litres of fluid daily</blockquote>
The first day  was a relatively easy ascent from the Marangu Gate at 1950m to Mandara Huts at  2700m.  Distance over the ground was approximately 12kms all through tropical  jungle, complete with a treetop audience of Colobus monkeys.  While this was  listed to take a reasonably leisurely 5 hours, the intense humidity made it hard  going.  Fortunately, I was prepared for this and drank water like a fish from my  Camelback system (a 3 litre water pouch carried in my daysack with a tube  allowing constant liquid top ups without the need for stopping).   On the first  4 days we were advised to consume over 5 litres of fluid daily.  As well as  preventing dehydration, this would help oxygenate our blood like a Tour de  France cyclist.

While we plodded up this path we were passed out by our crew of porters who  strode past us carrying our baggage, food and their own equipment.  They are  limited by law to a load of maximum 20kg each, which they mostly bundle up and  carry on their heads!

On arrival at Mandara we took an extra 1 hour excursion to Maundi Crater for  a sunset view over Kenya and of Mawenzi, the second highest peak of  Kilimanjaro.  While impressive to look at with its jagged teeth-like profile, at  only 5149m Mawenzi was not our prey – it was the presently hidden Kibo, at  5895m, that we sought.   Day 1? <em><strong>Hankuna matata</strong></em> as they  say in Swahili – No Problem.

<title>Irish Government Bonds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>What does Minister Noonan mean when he talks about “burning the bond holders”?</strong>

Currently burning the bondholders refers to the senior bonds of Nationwide and Anglo Irish bank. It has been the policy of the Fine Gael and Labour to “burn the bond holders” right through the election campaign and most recently on Minister Noonan’s trip to the US. Since taking office there has already been a burden sharing programme with the junior bond holders of AIB, Bank of Ireland and IL&amp;P. Since March 2011 the department of finance estimates that subordinated bond holders have contributed almost €10bln to the recapitalisation of the banking system.  The government has explicitly stated that it is not going to pursue burden sharing with the senior bond holders in the pillar banks (AIB, Bank of Ireland or IL&amp;P) and all of those bondholders will be repaid whether they are guaranteed or not. However Minster Noonan has stated that the state needs assistance in dealing with the senior bond holders of Anglo and Nationwide. 

<strong>How much money would this save the government?</strong>

Currently Anglo Irish Bank has €2.8bln worth of senior unsecured debt outstanding, €769mln of which is due to be paid back in the second half of 2011 and a further 1.9bln will be paid back in 2012. Irish Nationwide has €631mln of senior secured debt of which is due to be repaid in 2012. Therefore if there is going to be any burden sharing for these bond holders the government need to act promptly. It is unlikely that the entire €3.4bln could be written off but certainly a 50% reduction would be a possibility if burden sharing with senior bondholders is allowed. 

<strong>What hurdles is the government facing to such a strategy?</strong>

Noonan believes that because the merged Anglo and Irish Nationwide is just a “warehouse for impaired assets”, i.e. it no longer accepts deposits or lends money, it no longer works like a bank. 

This is now an issue for the IMF, the EU and the ECB. The difficulty arises with the ECB, who is very much against burden sharing with the private sector. The ECB is concerned about the contagion effects that any burden sharing may have on the European banking sector. As a result the policy stance from Europe has been clear that for now no burden sharing is allowed for senior bond holders. 

<strong>What is the implication for government bond markets from this policy?</strong>

The government is committed to repaying all of its obligations, either bonds that have been issued by the banks through the government or bonds that the government has issued itself to finance its own liabilities or money that it has borrowed from the EU/IMF. The only debt that it is considering imposing losses on is the senior unsecured debt of Anglo and Nationwide.

However the recent Greek crisis has created much turbulence in government bond markets particularly for Greek, Portuguese and Irish bonds because policy makers in the EU are now in favour of sharing the burden of Greece’s liabilities with the private sector, even though the ECB remained against any burden sharing. However the deal which has been negotiated in recent days includes some private sector involvement, although the details of which have yet to be hammered out. It is likely that any involvement by the private sector will have to be voluntary in order to avoid a credit event for the Greek sovereign and as a result needs to contain strong incentives to generate meaningful contribution to debt rollover. It currently looks like the private sector will be asked to voluntary swap bonds that are due to be repaid between now and 2014 with bonds that will mature much later.  
This reflects a turnaround in the policy stance from the EU, who previously had ruled out burden sharing until after 2013. Markets are now pricing in that Irish government bonds that mature after 2014 will only receive 70c for every €1 invested. 

<strong>What has to happen for Ireland to repay its commitments?</strong>

Currently the Irish government is on track to meet the targets set out by the EU/IMF and as a result is continuing to receive funding on from the programme every quarter. This was not the case for Greece and as a result Greece had a funding gap of €12bln in July. 

To continue to meet the EU/IMF austerity requirements Ireland must continue to enforce austerity. The government is committed to cutting an additional €3.6bln from its deficit in 2012, following the approximately €20bln that has been taken out of the economy since 2008. Further cuts will be made in 2013, 2014 and 2015. 

Economic growth is also essential to Ireland returning to a stable debt trajectory. Currently the Department of Finance estimates that the Irish economy can grow by 0.8% in 2011, 2.5% in 2012 and 3% thereafter until 2015. For this to happen global economy needs to continue to grow and the domestic economy needs to stabilise. 

It is certain the politics will play a major part. The political will needs to continue in Ireland to make the necessary cuts and reforms to bring the debt levels back to a stable trajectory. However it is also necessary that EU politicians remain willing to support the peripheral countries, continuing to provide funding for the region. Without this funding Ireland would have to fill the €18bln annual gap in its funding immediately as it is already locked out of the markets to raise this money.

Currently markets are pricing that growth, austerity and politics will fall down along the way and bond holders will not get all their money back. Ireland is different to Greece and Portugal in that it is a flexible economy with a strong export base which helps growth. However the high level of private sector debt is still a major burden for the economy.

<title>Commodity Price Inflation – The next major challenge to Central Banks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Commodity Price Inflation – The next major challenge to Central Banks</strong>

Markets focus on extremes, particularly when you look at the most recent inflation/deflation debate. Last summer the dominant concern was that the US and many of the western economies would experience a prolonged deflationary period. Currently focus has turned to the recent surge in commodity prices and now an “inflationary spiral” is back on the cards.

Headline inflation has been increasing globally; initially it was evident in the emerging region, most notably in China, where inflation currently stands 4.6% YoY. More recently concerns are shifting to developed economies. For example inflation in the UK surprised markets and jumped to 3.7% in December. Eurozone headline CPI increased by 2.2% in December ahead of the ECB’s preferred level of 2% as food and energy prices continued to rise. Even in Ireland which has seen deflation since 2009, saw CPI jump to 1.3% YoY in December by the largest since 2008, primarily driven by higher energy prices. However this increase in headline inflation has come when domestic demand has remained lacklustre in many economies.

Currently the inflationary driven pressures are coming from the recent rise commodity prices. In 2010 Irish Life Commodity Fund returned 24% and although some of this return is as a result of the weakness in the Euro, the dollar return for commodities was 9.1%. The agriculture sector was one of the out-performers, particularly as adverse weather conditions in many key food producing countries led to a supply shock for this sector. Since the start of 2011, food and energy prices have continued along this upward trajectory, spurring fears that the inflationary pressures will persist throughout 2011.

<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Commodity-Returns-2010.jpg"></a><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-236" title="Commodity Returns 2010" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Commodity-Returns-2010-1024x599.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="374" />

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">The problem with this higher commodity price inflation is that it has also led to speculation that central banks such as the Bank of England, ECB and Federal Reserve will have to reverse some of the extra loose monetary policies that have been undertaking to help these economies, before adequate growth is seen in these economies. It has been noted that central banks should not respond to a commodity related spike in inflation because such spikes are beyond their control. Emerging economies have already started to adopted tighter monetary policy as China has increased rates and started decreased the liquidity available in the banking sector. However the Federal Reserve to date is not concerned with this commodity led inflation and is continuing to print money and purchase government bonds in the market (through its $600bln quantitative easing programme). But speculation has started to mount over recent weeks that the ECB and Bank of England may be forced to tighten policy, soon than had been expected in line with their commitment to their inflation targeting. This is evident in the spike in the 2 year government bond yield in the UK and Germany.

<font face="Arial" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="3"> 

</font></font></span><font face="Arial" size="3"> 

</font></span><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;"><a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Market-price-in-interest-rate-hikes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-240" title="Market price in interest rate hikes" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Market-price-in-interest-rate-hikes-1024x610.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="381" /></a></span></strong>

Despite this, the recovery in the UK remains fragile, particularly as the economy contracted by 0.5% in the fourth quarter. Given the fiscal austerity measures that are currently being adopted by the UK government an increase in interest rates would cripple the domestic economy further. There are also concerns that like in 2008 when the ECB responded to commodity price inflation and raised interest rates that the ECB could act again, even though financial instability remains. It is imperative that central banks examine whether there are secondary effects to this commodity price inflation, particularly a shift in inflation expectations or wage price inflation. As can be seen from the chart below inflation expectations in Eurozone remain in line with the ECB’s target, allowing the ECB to remain on hold. For now a change from the current policy stance endangers the recovery as central banks would be responding to price increases that are already hampering the already fragile economic recovery.

<title>Key changes for pensions in budget 2011 – why the time to act is now!</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the financial situation facing the Government, the recent budget was always going to be a tough one – and early indications were that pensions were going to get hit badly. The reality is that, while some of the advantages have been cut slightly, the attractiveness and need for pensions is as strong as ever.

The most important thing to remember about pensions is that if you want any kind of financial security when you retire, you simply have to put some money away now.

In the current financial situation, relying on the State pension is unlikely to be an option. The state funds public pensions through taxes such as income tax. So the more people working, the more the Government has to spend on state benefits such as pensions. Just take a look at the following diagrams.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Pension-figures1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-328    aligncenter" title="Pension figures" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Pension-figures1.jpg" alt="" width="459" height="262" /></a></p>
This is going to put massive pressure on the public pension system, and we’re already seeing the results of that. The Government has announced that it is to increase the state pension age to 68 by 2028 and the reality is that, even if they can avoid cutting the state pension soon, it is quite likely that the amount will reduce in real terms over the coming years.

&#160;

This means that planning a pension is really important and it explains why, even after the budget cuts, the Government continues to give such good incentives for people to contribute to their pension.  Our <a href="http://www.irishlife.ie/advice/pension-calculator.html" target="_blank">pension <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">calculator</span></em> </a>is a simple tool which shows how much you should save in your pension.

So what was the impact of Budget 2011 on pensions? Here are some of the changes announced.

<strong>1. Removal of PRSI and Health Levy relief on pension contributions</strong>

Pension contributions generally receive income tax relief up to a percentage of your earnings –Self Employed people can claim relief when they submit tax returns. For those in employment, the tax relief is either given at source or by applying to your local Inspector of taxes to adjust your tax credits.

Even with the removal of PRSI and health levy relief a tax payer on 41% tax will still get €41 back in tax relief for every €100 they invest. Similarly, a tax payer on 20% tax will get €20 back in tax relief for every €100 they invest. Their pension fund will grow fully tax free, meaning that their funds would grow at a higher rate than savings funds. Finally, they can access a portion of their funds tax free (usually a quarter) and the rest will be taxed as an income, meaning that some will be tax free, some at 20% and only the remainder at 41%. PRSI will be deducted and the Universal Social Charge (replacing Health and Income Levies) will now also apply to pensions in payment.

<strong>2.         Limiting the ability of high earners to fund very large pensions</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tax free lump sum is capped at €200,000 </strong></li>
</ul>
In terms of the maximum tax free lump sum of €200,000, most pension holders can take a quarter of their fund tax free, so this will generally only impact you if your fund is over €800,000. Even if you <em>are</em> lucky enough to have a fund of that size or more, you can still take the balance taxed at 20%.

For example, as the diagram below shows, if you had a fund of €1 million, you could take €250,000 cash - €200,000 would be tax free and €50,000 would be taxed at 20% - meaning you just pay €10,000 tax or 4% of the cash amount.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Pension-Graph.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-269" title="Pension Graph" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Pension-Graph.jpg" alt="" width="484" height="253" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Allowable income for tax relief purposes is capped at €115,000 </strong></li>
</ul>
For example, if you’re 50 you can get relief on pension contributions of 30% of salary - this is now capped at €34,500 (30% of €115,000 per year). Also, it doesn’t affect the amount your employer can contribute for you through a company pension.
<ul>
<li><strong>The total pension fund you can build is capped at €2.3 million. </strong></li>
</ul>
In reality, it will not impact on most pension savers as most don’t earn over €115,000 and won’t build up a fund of over €2.3 million. However, even if you <em>do</em> earn over that amount, it only caps the personal contribution to your pension that you can get tax relief on.

Why not take a look at how pension tax relief can <a title="how pension tax relief helps" href="http://www.irishlife.ie/guides/how-pension-tax-relief-helps.html" target="_blank">help you</a>

<strong>3. Minimum withdrawals on ARFs increased to 5%</strong>

The idea of an Approved Retirement Fund or “ARF” is that it’s a fund you have after you retire that you can use to draw down an income from. Some people were’nt using it for that purpose, but were keeping it intact to pass on to their dependents. Because of this, the Government decided to tax these funds as if you had drawn down 3% a year, this has been increased to 5% in the budget with immediate effect (December 2010). So it makes more sense, tax wise, to actually draw down 5% a year as income.

If you take a regular withdrawal from this product, it’s possible that expected growth may be lower than expected and taking a regular withdrawal could reduce the capital you’ve invested.

These were the main changes in the recent budget.

<strong>Working to maintain tax-relief incentives on pensions</strong>

In the Governments 4 year plan, there was an additional proposal that between 2012 and 2014 tax relief on pensions could be reduced to the lower rate of tax (currently 20%). We’re hopeful of finding a solution that works for the Government and continues to provide a strong incentive for people to save for their retirement.

So in summary:
<ul>
<li>You really need to sort out your own pension. Even if it’s just a small one, when added to the state benefit, it will make a difference</li>
<li>Pensions remain a tax efficient way to build up money for retirement</li>
<li>It is possible that tax relief could reduce in the future, so it’s worthwhile considering how you can maximize how much you contribute to your pension now.<em> </em></li>
</ul>
This article is meant to just give a broad overview of some of the main changes to pensions in the recent budget. If you need to review your pension plan, it’s important that you talk to your <a href="http://www.irishlife.ie/advice/arrange-a-financial-review.html" target="_blank">financial advisor</a>  or contact us at <a href="mailto:mcustomerservice@irishlife.ie">customerservice@irishlife.ie</a>.

<strong>Warning: The income you get from this investment may go down as well as up. The value of your investment go down as well as up.</strong>

Pensions are a long term investment plan that can only be taken at retirement. Irish Life Assurance is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.<strong></strong>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2012 Irish Life paid out a total of €83.5 million in Life Insurance benefits held by 1,168 customers.  A further €41.5m was paid out to 606 customers in respect of Specified Illness Cover plans.

Included in those figures, is a payment of over €5 million, the highest claim paid by the company in 7 years.

Irish Life Head of Claims, Martin Duffy, said that the €5 million Life Insurance payment is the highest made by Irish Life in the past 7 years and compares to the highest claim paid in 2011 of €700,000.  “There were a number of very high (€1m +) claims paid out in 2012 which reflects, in part, the higher value insurance which people acquired in the boom years.”  

Duffy said, however, the average claim for Life Insurance was just over €71,500.  “We did have a number of very large payments last year, but the fact that the average payment was just €71,500 suggests that the level of Life Insurance taken out by many Irish people is still insufficient to look after their dependants in the event of an early death, especially as the average age of adult claims is 62”.

<title>Inflation on the prowl in 2011</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Below please find a summary of our views - please click on link for full article.

<strong>Inflation on the prowl in 2011</strong>
<ul>
<li>Equities should perform reasonably well in 2011, but will face  a number of headwinds – in general, we believe quality large  cap companies look attractively valued, especially on a  comparative basis.</li>
<li>We would be cautious about long-term government bond markets in the core Euro area and in the U.S. and the U.K. this year. On the other hand, Irish 10-year government bond yields at around 9% look a tempting proposition but do carry a higher risk of default.</li>
<li> Deposit rates will likely remain broadly unchanged in 2011 but the actual rates on offer will vary from institution to institution.</li>
<li>Commodities should continue to perform strongly over the next 12 months, underpinned by continued strong emerging market demand and easy policy conditions in the West.</li>
<li>Irish commercial property values are expected to continue to drift lower due to weakening rental values (yields should remain broadly stable). However, the market appears to be close to its cyclical bottom and looks attractively valued. U.K. and core Euro area markets will continue to see strong investor interest for prime secure properties but non prime property values will remain under pressure.</li>
<li> In general, investors and savers need to guard against the risk of rising inflation and a greater allocation to real financial assets is warranted.</li>
<li> There are a number of obvious risks facing the markets in 2011 and these include Higher inflation, sovereign risk contagion and political flare-ups in Asia, especially the North-South Korea stand-off.</li>
</ul>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>“Neither a borrower nor a lender be; for loan oft loses both itself and friend, and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry”. </em>

<strong><em>"Hamlet", Act 1 scene 3</em></strong><em></em>

William Shakespeare must be turning in his grave given the debt laden ways of the modern western world. Unfortunately, for us (that is the Irish) we certainly didn’t pay any heed to this advice as we over-borrowed during the boom years. However, we’re attempting to mend our ways, as Irish households have increased their savings quite significantly in recent years and are in the process of repairing their “balance sheets”.

With the increased level of uncertainty in the domestic economy, cash funds and deposits – once the choice of the conservative investor – have become a more attractive investment option for a broad spectrum of Irish investors. Deposit rates can vary quite significantly from one institution to another in the Irish market and looking at the rate on 6 month deposit accounts for example, it ranged from as low as 0.5% to as high as 2.85% at the end of last year. However, it is not the actual rate of interest that has driven the demand for deposits by Irish investors and savers, but rather a desire for safety. Consequently, Irish households continued to favour having access to their money over higher potential returns and preferred deposits and cash funds over real financial assets, such as equities and shares over the last 12 months.

<strong>Irish households have built up huge cash savings</strong>

Irish households have shown very conservative saving and spending habits over the last couple of years. Household’s savings increased from €3.6 billion in 2008 to over €11 billion in 2009 – the only sector to show an increase in savings over this period. The household net saving ratio, which expresses net savings as a percentage of net disposable income, increased from 3.9% in 2008 to 12.3% in 2009, with this trend likely to have continued in 2010. The saving rate is expected to stay high for this year and the foreseeable future. It is estimated that Irish households have somewhere in the region of €100 billion sitting in cash and deposit accounts. The key motivation, as we have mentioned, is a precautionary one but one has to suspect that once domestic fears subside that there will be pent-up demand to spend and invest. Evidence of the potential for the Irish consumer to spend can be seen from growth in car sales this year, spurred admittedly by the government’s car scrappage scheme. In November, motor sales increased by just under 15% in year-on-year terms. This pent-up demand could in time increase domestic inflationary pressures along with the rise in commodity prices in the global economy.

<strong>The real cost of deposits</strong>

While having money on deposit and in cash reduces the risk, it does come with a significant opportunity cost when assets, such as equities, commodities, property and corporate bonds perform positively. Last year was a case in point where most risk assets produced strong returns, with about half of the returns for both equities and commodities were due to the weakening of the euro currency. In euro terms in 2010 global equities returned 20.6%, while commodities returned 16.9% according to the S&amp;P GSCI Commodities Index. Commercial property in the U.K. and in the euro area performed strongly last year helped by increased institutional investor interest. Last year, however, was not a particularly good one for Irish assets, with equities, property and government bonds all showing negative returns. In terms of fund performance, funds with a broad spread of assets, such as Irish Life’s Consensus fund which increased by 12%, have performed well. Consensus is a managed fund that is diversified across assets and geographic regions.

<strong>Positive on equities and commodities in 2011</strong>

In general, we are positive on global equities and commodities in 2011 based on a number of reasons:
<ol>
<li>We expect that the global economy will continue to grow this year, exhibiting solid growth in the region of 4.5%. The IMF forecasts that global growth will average around 4.5% over the next four to five years, with emerging economies being the key driver of growth.<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMF-Forecasts1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-373" title="IMF Forecasts" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMF-Forecasts1.jpg" alt="" width="677" height="389" /></a><a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMF-GDP-Growth-Forecasts.jpg"></a></li>
<li>Monetary and fiscal policy, which is the control of money supply and the use of government expenditure and revenue, is expected to remain very supportive for the most of 2011.</li>
<li> Valuations of company shares, while not distinctly cheap, are below long-term averages. The fact that earnings growth outstripped the growth in prices in 2010 saw the valuation of many markets improve in 2010 and are now below their long-term averages. Plus, the dividend yields offered by many equity markets across the globe are now as attractive as the yield on ten-year government bond markets in the major developed countries.</li>
<li>The risk of deflation appears to be reducing and this should see some element of pricing power returning to companies, particularly those with strong franchises. Commodity prices started to fluctuate again last year, especially non-cyclical ones such as gold and agriculture commodities. However, there does appear to be something of a shift towards more economically sensitive commodities such as copper and oil. Consequently, with rising commodity prices, the danger of deflation does appear to be reducing. </li>
</ol>
<strong>But risks are evident</strong>

There are many risks in the global economy and the most pressing at the moment include the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and concerns about rising inflationary pressures. The fact that Europe has still failed to tackle the debt crisis in a fully planned and co-ordinated fashion means the markets will look to target individual countries and their respective bond markets. This will continue to unsettle equity markets on occasion this year. In terms of inflation, equity markets like a little but not too much. The general consensus is that inflation should be reasonably contained in 2011, but any unexpected surprises will raise the spectre of higher official rates at some stage during the year.

<strong>Summary</strong>

Despite this, continued strong earnings, supportive valuations and robust corporate balance sheets are likely to support equity markets during 2011. We believe that the returns from cash this year will not be able to match the performance from risky assets, similar to what occurred in 2010. However, regardless of what actually happens in terms of respective returns this year, the other significant risk is that inflation will take hold in the Irish economy again and that it will erode the purchasing power of Irish households’ savings over the longer-term. This is the hidden cost of placing all of your money on deposit.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Whatever the pre-cash investment vehicles were for the average Irish investor, and then the 'dash to cash' panic response, and whatever follows on from that from here on, to me, raises concerns about average Irish investor expertise and decisions/responses seeming more haphazard &amp; panic-based than strategy-based. How do our patterns of investor behaviour through all this compare with other, perhaps more experienced, investor nations such as the US, Canada or the UK? Accepting, of course, that there are many very experienced and capable Irish investors, but trying to take a perspective on the average.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The dash for cash and government bonds has been a pronounced feature in the U.S. and the U.K., with huge flows in to government bond mutual funds in the U.S. So, the desire for security and the heightened sense of risk aversion was/is not unique to Irish investors and savers. However, I do think the scale of the economic crisis in Ireland has exacerbated these trends and may mean the retail investors at home will be slower to take on real financial assets than those in other countries. Not only will Irish investors suffer an opportunity cost (that is the differential between what they earn on cash/deposit versus the returns on other asset classes) but also suffer from a loss of purchasing power because of rising inflation.]]></wp:comment_content>

<title>League v Championship</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So the national league has started and for the first time in a number of years, there are no experimental rules for a referee to deal with!

This time of year is not an easy time to referee gaelic games. Bad weather &amp; the resulting heavy state of county pitches gives rise to much slower games of football with more clusters of players scraping for possession than you will see later in the year.

You sometimes hear managers and players refer to two sets of rules in gaelic games, one set for the league and another set for the championship. As a referee, I only have one set of rules to work with throughout the year.

The problem for the referee is that teams don’t change their style between championship and league, with possession and constant hand-passing remaining the name of the game. More mistakes are likely to happen in the league than later in the championship, as players find their feet again after the winter break. There are many more challenges for possession and more tackling among numerous players for the referee to adjudicate on. The game becomes more open in the championship as the speed increases at least four fold versus the league.

As the league progresses, players get fitter and the pace of each subsequent round of games quickens. The referee’s fitness level needs to build from game to game in the league as well. People often say to me that football referees have to be fitter these days because of the speed of the game but that the hurling referees must have to be fitter again. There’s no doubt that hurling is the faster game but while fitness is obviously important for a hurling referee, positioning and making sure you’re not too close to the play at any given time is arguably more important. There are so many  break-downs of play in football and the opportunity for cluster defending, etc. that fitness and closeness to the play is much more important for top inter-county football referees.

That probably shows itself in fitness tests, like the one just gone. With the exception of Barry Kelly (hurling) who is extremely fit, the majority of referees achieving the highest scores in the bleeper test are football referees. Nothing like a bit of friendly competition between the football &amp; hurling referees!

As the league begins, it’s probably a good time to point out one or two of the common misperceptions out there:
<ul>
<li>A linesman cannot bring a technical foul, like a pick off the ground or an illegal hand-pass, to the attention of the referee regardless of how close to him it may have happened.</li>
<li>The fact that the free count might have been 40-20 in a game doesn’t mean that a referee was biased, it just means that one team fouled more than the other!</li>
<li>A referee doesn’t distinguish in any way between the strong &amp; the so-called weak teams.</li>
<li>A referee taking charge of a game where one team is from his own province does not referee that game any differently to one where both teams are from outside his province. I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, that all referees at inter-county level are extremely professional people who take their role in gaelic games very seriously.</li>
</ul>
On a personal note, I’m glad the last few weeks of year-end work are behind me so that I can increase my focus on fitness and involvement in the national football league as it unfolds. Like every player, every referee just wants to be involved in the big games.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><em>“Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell.”</em></strong><strong> </strong> -Sir John Templeton<a href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/t540/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK2A/Weekly%20-%20Why%20do%20retail%20investors%20buy%20when%20they%20should%20sell%20sell%20when%20they%20should%20buy.doc#_ftn1">[1]</a>

<strong>Why do investors buy when they should sell, sell when they should buy?</strong>

Unfortunately for most retail investors their interest in any particular asset class generally only manifests itself once optimism abounds and the underlying bull market is showing signs of aging. Retail interest reaches a peak when the horizon is apparently clear and euphoria starts to take hold.

Conversely, the point of maximum selling by retail investors also tends to occur at the height of maximum pessimism. These traits are all understandable and have been explained in the annals of behavioural finance but they are deadly in terms of returns.

In very simple terms, emotion impacts on the decision to invest. More often than not, the best time to invest is when everyone else is selling, and the economic outlook is clouded with uncertainty and nervousness. However, it is also the most difficult time to make that decision.

The following chart illustrates the pattern of retail clients tending to buy high and sell low – a strategy that is not conducive to very positive results. The yellow line is the total return on global equities (the year-over-year change in the MSCI All Country World Total Return Stock Index in U.S. dollars) and the blue line is net new cash flows into equity mutual funds in the U.S., which is largely retail money.  What is readily apparent is that both lines move pretty much in tandem. It is a near perfect chart of the buy high/sell low characteristic of retail investors and the high correlation between market returns and investor interest.

<strong>Retail investors follow performance and end up buying high and selling low</strong>

<strong><a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/retail-investors-follow-performance.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-322" title="retail-investors-follow-performance" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/retail-investors-follow-performance.png" alt="" width="750" height="492" /></a>
</strong>

The last couple of years offer a clear insight into this type of behaviour by retail investors. In early 2009, global equity markets were at their lows but the selling by retail clients was at its most intense. By that stage global equity markets had fallen by approximately 50% to 60% and retail investors were still dumping equities by the truck load, somewhere in the region of $40 billion a month. And it was only after the market had rallied by 70%, did retail investor flows turn positive.

<strong>A more extreme pattern evolving at home</strong>

A more extreme pattern has happened in Ireland over the last two years, as Irish households want only safety and security and care little about performance. Irish households have been stockpiling cash and deposits and paying down debts over the last two years, with the actual savings rate hitting an astonishing 12.3% in 2009 or approximately €11 billion. This trend was probably repeated last year, but official numbers won’t be released for a number of months yet.

<strong>Irish households are in the process of de-leveraging </strong>

According to the Irish Central Bank<a href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/t540/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK2A/Weekly%20-%20Why%20do%20retail%20investors%20buy%20when%20they%20should%20sell%20sell%20when%20they%20should%20buy.doc#_ftn1">[2]</a>, ‘Households’ net lending <em>(that is saving and paying off debt)</em> increased further in Q3 2010, reaching almost €4 billion, its highest level to date. The <em>(following)</em> chart shows that the increase in net lending has been driven in part by households’ investment in financial assets <em>(largely cash and deposits)</em>, but also largely by a reduction in household liabilities. Since late 2009, households have been undergoing a period of deleveraging as they have sought to reduce high debt levels. The high household net lending figures indicate that household saving continues to be high in Q3 2010.’

<strong>From ‘flaithiul’ to frugal</strong>

Irish households are no longer spendthrifts

<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/from-faithful-to-frugal.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321" title="from-faithful-to-frugal" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/from-faithful-to-frugal.png" alt="" width="750" height="448" /></a>

<strong>Understandable, but opportunities missed</strong>

Given the scale of the economic calamity that has befallen the Irish economy over the last couple of years it is understandable why investors and savers have flocked to cash. But this has occurred at the expense of 90% plus returns in global equities since the lows of 2009. Furthermore, while the easy gains have been made we believe that equity markets can produce quite strong returns over the next 12 to 18 months and easily beat what is on offer on deposit. Using Sir John Templeton’s famous quote as a guide, we believe that we are in the sceptical stage of the cycle and that markets have still to benefit from widespread optimism.

One simple and very effective way of over coming the highs and lows of markets and the attendant emotions is to invest via a savings plan (a.k.a. dollar cost averaging).

The advantages of regularly investing via a savings plan:

• Investing regularly allows investors and savers to buy more units when financial markets are low and buy fewer units when markets are more expensive.

• Investors and savers don’t have to worry about deciding when is the right time to make an investment as they are buying the units in their chosen funds at the ‘average’ price.

<strong>When falling markets are good for savers!</strong>

The simplified example below highlights the benefit of taking out a savings plan. That is, as the value of the fund falls in year 2 the saver gets the advantage of buying units when the prices are low. However in year 3, when the unit price rises the saver buys fewer units. It sounds crazy, but for somebody starting a savings plan they should actually cheer a bear market in the early years of a plan. This is an example only and is not an accurate indication of the actual or future performance of any particular fund.

<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/falling-markets-good-for-savers.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-317" title="falling-markets-good-for-savers" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/falling-markets-good-for-savers.png" alt="" width="610" height="137" /></a>

Investors and savers in Ireland have very big allocations to cash and deposits and a more meaningful allocation to real financial assets, such as equities are warranted especially those with a long term investment horizon. And a good stepping stone for the nervous investor/saver is a simple savings plan.

<title>A prompt for action - claims paid and True Grit</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>A prompt for action - claims paid and True Grit</strong>

I saw a review of the new ‘True Grit’ film on The View recently. I remember seeing the original in the cinema in 1970 as a child! It was fantastic and still one of my favourite films. Little did I know I would be showing the original to my four daughters all these years later!!

There is something important about having the courage or ‘true grit’, as a couple with children, to discuss what would happen financially if one parent died. Not a pleasant conversation.

In the same way looking at real claims data can also serve this purpose in highlighting the need for action.

When you do a good thing like taking out some life assurance cover to protect your family, if you were to die, you really never think about a claim ever happening.

Each year in January we in Irish Life do a review of all protection claims paid in the previous year to both improve the claims process and help customers to better understand the importance of having cover in place.

As part of this review this time, we also looked at claims paid by Irish Life in the last 5 years. Incredibly we have paid out over €1,000,000,000 in protection claims to over 30,000 Irish families over this time.

During 2010 we paid claims under life assurance and specified illness plans to residences in every county and corner in Ireland. We are a locally based company paying claims locally for over 70 years.

Our 2010 data reveals some surprising information:

<strong>In respect of death claims…..</strong>

Average claim amount on death claim was only €65,000. Clearly inadequate to provide a realistic level of replacement income to a surviving family.

11% of the 1256 death claims paid during 2010 were as a result of an accident or unintended death (road traffic accidents, work related accidents, fires, drowning etc). 30 death claims in respect of road traffic accidents.

Average age of deceased for under all the accidental deaths was only 47.

70% of these accidental deaths were on male lives.

52% of all death claims for lives under aged 40 were as a result of an accident. Some people think they don’t need life assurance cover as they as healthy! Well if you are 40 and healthy, that’s great but based on our claims experience, for 1 in 2 deaths under age 40, the cause of your death will be an accident.

How unexpected a death can occur
<ul>
<li>during 2010 we paid a death claim on a man in his 30s who died in Road Traffic Accident  only 8 months after cover was taken out – over €300,000 paid.</li>
<li>also in 2010, we paid a death claim on a man in his 40s who died in a work place accident only 3 months after cover was taken out – over €100,000 paid.</li>
</ul>
Largest claim paid in 2010 was €1.2 million to a man in 60s who died as a result of bowel cancer.

<strong>In respect of Specified Illness claims…..</strong>

Of the 569 claims, malignant cancer is biggest cause of specified illness cover claim at 58% and heart related at 22%. For women malignant breast cancer is biggest with 85 claims. For men its heart related with 54 claims, and then followed by malignant cancer of prostate with 50 claims.

How unexpected a specified illness cover event can occur:
<ul>
<li>during 2010 we paid one specified illness cover claim to a woman in her 40s for malignant breast cancer - €50,000 plan in place for only 1 year.</li>
<li>During 2010 we paid a claim for a civil servant for a heart attack - €50,000, plan in place for 11 months.</li>
</ul>
Largest SIC claim paid in 2010 was for €500,000 to a man in his 40s for a heart attack. Largest female claims for lung cancer – women in 50s €300,000 paid.

Lots more claim information on our website. Real claims. Real people.

PS We are proud of the fact that we have paid 95% of all death and specified illness claims during 2010. What do you think of this?

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>It’s not all roses for emerging markets – Some risks to be aware of</strong>

China is now the world’s second largest economy after it over took Japan and expectations are now mounting that China could take over from the US as the world’s largest economy in ten years time. In fact, growth in emerging economies is expected to significantly outstrip that of developed economies over the coming years as evident by Chart 1

Moreover there has been a change in the flow of funds, particularly in the latter weeks of January. Morgan Stanley has reported that emerging market funds have experienced strong outflows, following the large inflows that were evident through 2009 and 2010.

<strong>Chart 1: Emerging market economies are expected drive global growth</strong>

<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMF-GDP-Growth-Forecasts1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-350" title="IMF GDP Growth Forecasts" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMF-GDP-Growth-Forecasts1.jpg" alt="" width="701" height="385" /></a> 

There are very strong fundamentals for investors having an exposure to emerging market assets, as emerging economies do not carry the financial woes that developed economies do, the demographics of these population are much stronger than developed, the population of China and India are becoming richer and hence will become large consumers. Emerging markets asset classes have weathered the financial crisis much better than developed markets and have outperformed over the past two years. Despite this investors should be aware of some near term risks for these asset classes. 

 As evident by Chart 2 emerging market equities have been underperforming developed market equities since October 2010, after consistently outperforming since September 2009. 

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-353" title="Monthly returns of emerging markets" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Monthly-returns-of-emerging-markets.jpg" alt="" width="717" height="356" /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"></span></span>

Moreover, there has been a change in the flow of funds, particularly in the latter weeks of January.  Morgan Stanley has reported that emerging market funds have experienced strong outflows, following the large inflows that were evident through 2009 and 2010.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-355" title="EM Funds" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/EM-Funds.jpg" alt="" width="722" height="387" /> 

The change in sentiment towards emerging markets has come as concerns about the sustainability of the recovery, in the region is now in question. The change in allocation to developed markets has come as a result of three reasons in our view: 
<ol>
<li>Tighter monetary policy as a result of rising inflation in emerging economies.</li>
<li>Concerns about the overheating of the Chinese economy, in particular the property sector.</li>
<li>General improvement in the outlook for developed economies</li>
</ol>
<strong>Shift from a pro-growth to tightening policy stance</strong> 

Emerging market headline CPI and PPI indices are running at over 5%, according to Morgan Stanley. The drivers of this high inflation are low real interest rates and higher food prices. Food prices on average represent 30% of the CPI basket for emerging markets (in contrast to around 10% in developed market CPI indices) and expectations are that food prices will continue to rise into 2011. 

This has resulted in a tighter monetary policy stance from central banks. For example China has raised rates three times in four months and raised the required reserve ratio (i.e. the amount of reserves that it requires it’s banking sector to hold on deposit). India, Taiwan, Korea, Brazil have also raised rates. The tightening monetary policy stance could lead to continued underperformance of emerging equity markets versus developed markets as the central banks of developed economies are expected to remain on hold through 2011. 

<strong>Overheating of the Chinese economy</strong> 

China is a very central story to investing in emerging markets, not only because it represents 17% of the MSCI emerging market index, but it is also a key driver of growth in the Asian region. Elsewhere China also is also a major driver of commodity prices which boosts the economies of Latin America and EMEA. 

Growth in China is expected to slow from 10.3% in 2010, to close to 9% in 2011 and 2012 as the effects of the government stimulus that was introduced in 2009 eases. One major concern for commentators is that there is a housing bubble in some of the cities in China. According to the Financial Times, the value of housing stock is set to exceed 350% of GDP in 2011, while construction currently accounts for around 25% 

of GDP, which is similar to the level that Ireland reached prior to the collapse. Property prices in China have risen continuously over the past decade and since 2009 the amount of outstanding credit has jumped.  There is anecdotal evidence that millions of apartments are empty in Chinese cities, despite the urbanisation of the Chinese population. This is certainly a risk to the Chinese outlook to be aware of, however timing the burst of a bubble is never easy, but tighter credit conditions or an increase in the cost of credit could be a catalyst. 

<strong>Recent improvement in the outlook for developed markets</strong> 

Expectations are that global economic growth will be robust for 2011 and 2012, albeit slightly shy of the growth seen in 2010. It is also expected that the growth will be diverse between regions. The economic outlook for developed markets appears to be improving, albeit on the back of government stimulus measures and strong global trade. On the other hand there has been some increase in negative sentiment towards emerging markets, as central banks start to tighten policy. These changing dynamics have also been reflected in the respective business confidence surveys for  both regions. Consequently, it would not be surprising if developed equity markets put in a period of out-performance versus emerging markets in the months ahead.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Appointments for rounds 2 &amp; 3 of the National Football League were made on Monday evening. I’ve been appointed to take charge of the Dublin-Cork game in Croke Park this Saturday.  

Preparations for the league have been going well since the year-end valuation work started to quieten down.  Training three days last week &amp; a game in Meath at the weekend has got my fitness levels back up to a good standard for this time of year. One more gym session on Friday morning – a bleep test being run in the staff gym – will be the last physical exercise before the game.

I’ve also been using the new inter-county referees’ website to prepare for the weekend. It’s probably the biggest development in refereeing education in the last 10 years.  The website has numerous video clips of technical and aggressive fouls from the 2011 provincial winter tournaments and the 1<sup>st</sup> round of the National League available for all inter county referees to review and learn from.  There are also discussion videos that referees are asked to comment on in order to encourage healthy debate on particular elements of the game.

I’ll meet my umpires early on Saturday and we’ll spend a good length of time discussing effective teamwork, positioning &amp; communication in the game.  They know they are as much under the spotlight as I am in inter-county games and future refereeing appointments are as much in their hands as they are in mine.  There can be a perception out there that umpires are just a group of the referee’s friends, with no formal training in the rules of the game. This perception is untrue.  My umpires are trained and I have full confidence in them.  If I didn’t, they wouldn’t be with me.  I can’t afford to have a weak link on my team, given the importance of all inter-county games nowadays.  I’ve had to make big decisions in the recent past regarding my team of umpires, decisions which weren’t popular at home (!) but ones which had to be made given where I want to be as a referee.

The weekend will also be a first for the recent changes to the referees’ assessment system.  While we will still get independently assessed, this season we get the opportunity to assess our own performances.  This is taking a leaf out of the AFL system of referees’ performance appraisal. I would probably be my own harshest critic.  I normally don’t need anyone to tell me what did or didn’t go well in a game.  I have very high expectations of myself and the level of performance that I need to satisfy to stay at this level.  I might have refereed two All Ireland finals but you can’t take anything for granted as it only takes a second for one incident to change the course of your inter-county refereeing career.  

I’m looking forward to Saturday.  The build-up has started.  I’ll be thinking about lots of refereeing related issues between now &amp; then as I zone into this game and out of everything else – it happens every time.  Hopefully everything will go well and everyone can enjoy a good, sporting game of football.]]></content:encoded>

<title>What the papers said about our claims statistics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://irishlife.ie/guides/guide-to-irish-life-claims-2006-2010.html"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.irishlife.ie/uploadedImages/retail/img/banner/banner.billion.png" alt="" width="725" /></a></br>

Earlier in the week, we launched our <a title="2010 claims statistics" href="http://www.irishlife.ie/advice/2010-life-cover-claim-statistics.html" target="_self">2010 claims statistics</a>, a breakdown of the life cover, serious illness and income protection claims that we paid out over the last year.</p>
This launch also marked an important milestone for Irish Life, marking over <a title="2006-2010 claims data" href="http://www.irishlife.ie/guides/guide-to-irish-life-claims-2006-2010.html" target="_self">€1 billion in claims paid</a> over the past 5 years. The announcement received good coverage overall in the national press, a breakdown of which we've included here;

Conor Pope, consumer affairs correspondent with the Irish Times gave a good breakdown of the figures, noting that there has been a substantial rise in claims on illness and life policies. <a title="Irish Times article" onclick="if (_gaq) _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'External link', 'irish times article']);return true" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2011/0214/1224289736998.html">Article here.</a>

Charlie Weston, personal finance editor for the Independent, wrote that Irish life had paid out over €1 billion on claims last year! Whilst flattering, the correct time frame for the €1 billion paid was over the last five years, but we'll forgive him. Here's a <a title="independent articel on claims" onclick="if (_gaq) _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'External link', 'independent article']);return true" href="http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/irish-life-paid-out-euro1bn-to-30000--last-year-on-policy-claims-2538926.html">link to his piece.</a>

Evelyn Ring, writing in the Irish Examiner, also covered the announcement. In <a title="examiner article on Irish life claims" onclick="if (_gaq) _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'External link', 'examiner article']);return true" href="http://www.irishexaminer.ie/ireland/25-will-get-serious-illness-145216.html" target="_self">her article</a> she focussed on the fact that one in four people will suffer from a serious illness at some stage in their life.

Finally, Deborah Condon, writing in <a title="irishhealth.com article" onclick="if (_gaq) _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'External link', 'irishhealth article']);return true" href="http://www.irishhealth.com/article.html?id=18662">irishhealth.com</a> focused on the cancer figures in the announcement, noting that almost half of the life assurance claims for 2010 related to the disease.

You can read more about our 2010 claims announcement, in this <a title="Martin Duffys blog post" href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/2011/02/a-prompt-for-action-claims-paid-and-true-grit/">blog post</a> by Martin Duffy, head of underwriting, life new business and protection claims for Irish Life.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="_mcePaste">As a result of the underperformance of Eurozone equities through 2010, mainly due to the problems in the debt burden of peripheral countries such as Spain, Portugal, Greece and</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">Ireland, valuation for the Eurozone region now look attractive versus the rest of the world. As</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">evident from Chart 1, equities in the peripheral region underperformed, while a stronger</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">performance was evident for countries in the core region on the back of the robust recovery for</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">these regions.</div><br/><br/>
<div><a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/underperformance-eurozone-equities-e1298370352463.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-395" title="underperformance-eurozone-equities" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/underperformance-eurozone-equities-e1298370352463.png" alt="" width="695" height="437" /></a></div><br/>
<div>
<div>As a result of this underperformance valuation levels for the Eurozone countries are now</div>
<div>cheaper on price earnings as well as on a dividend yield basis than other developed markets.</div>
<div>In our view there are two issues for Eurozone equities going forward</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>The likelihood of a credible solution to the Eurozone Sovereign crisis for the peripheral countries.</li>
<li>The sustainability of the recovery for the core region.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div><a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/price-earnings.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-396" title="price-earnings" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/price-earnings.png" alt="" width="704" height="387" /></a></div><br/>
<div><strong>The Eurozone Sovereign Crisis </strong></div>
<div>
<div>Since the start of 2011, the asset classes that had been affected by the sovereign crisis such as the</div>
<div>government bonds and equities in the peripheral regions as well as the Euro have outperformed on the expectation that Eurozone policy makers will present a broad range of reforms to contain this crisis at their next meeting on March 24th. The continued out-performance of these asset classes is very much dependent of these reforms being introduced. It is also important that these reforms are seen as a credible and adequate resolution to the crisis. There has been a significant shift in the policy stance of EU policy makers since the start of the year. To date markets have been focusing on the following policy responses:</div><br/><br/>
<div><strong>1. Size of the Fund:</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong>The EFSF fund was reduced to €257.3bln during the summer, as this was the maximum amount that the fund could lend if it were to maintain the necessary AAA status from the credit agencies. It is now expected that European policy makers will increase the EFSF fund back to its original size of €440bln or a total of €750bln when the IMF funds are also included. This means that the current AAA countries in Europe will have to commit extra capital and hence take on an increased burden and potential higher interest rate. Ireland is currently the only country that has drawn down funds and €67bln are coming from the lending facility in place. There are projections that Portugal would require €80bln, Spain would require €350bln and it is also expected that Greece may need an additional €50bln in 2012 that has not already been covered by the €110bln package that it received last May.</div><br/><br/>
<div><strong> 2. Decline in the borrowing costs </strong></div>
<div>Currently the average borrowing cost for Ireland is 5.8%, which is regarded as very punitive, especially if Ireland is expected to be able to return to a stable debt trajectory. Currently the EFSF is able to borrow from the market at a rate of 2.9% on five year duration. It is expected that policy makers will adjust the rate that they are charging Ireland and other drawers from the fund lower, although the size of the adjustment is unknown.</div><br/><br/>
<div><strong>3. EFSF will intervene in distress bond markets and buy bonds</strong></div>
<div>By granting the EFSF the ability to purchase government bonds in either the primary or secondary markets at current market prices, may allow governments to take a haircut on their bonds, without triggering a “CDS” or default. This solution would decrease the debt burden for countries.</div>
<div><br/><br/>
<div>All of these rumoured remedies require support from AAA countries to the peripheral countries. To date the Eurozone domestic policies has been a hurdle to any remedy, however since the start of the year authorities in France and Germany particularly have showed signs that they are committed to pre-emptively tackling the crisis.</div>
</div><br/><br/>
<div><strong>Investment consequence for DJ Euro Stoxx 600 Index </strong></div>
<div>
<div>The performance of Eurozone equities will be very much determined on whether or not these resolutions are enforced. Currently 24% of the DJ Euro Stoxx 600 is invested in the peripheral countries of Spain (11.1%), Italy (10.1%), Ireland (1.1%), Portugal (0.9%) and Greece (1.1%).  23% of the DJ Euro Stoxx 600 Index are financial stocks, which is the sector that is most exposed to this crisis. In January the financial sector outperformed as the contagion risks from the crisis decline and more importantly the funding costs for banks also decline. The banking sectors of non peripheral banks are implicated as a result of the exposure to peripheral countries’ bonds and banks. The major risk to this scenario is that the remedies will disappoint market expectations.</div><br/><br/>
<div><strong>The robust performance of the Core Eurozone Region </strong></div>
<div>Despite the uncertainties in the peripheral Eurozone, the German economy grew strongly in 2010 and is expected to continue to perform strongly in 2011. Currently business confidence as measured by the IFO, is at an all time high, while the PMI business confidence for the manufacturing and services sectors are all above the highs reached in the first quarter 2010. To date much of the strength in the Eurozone has been driven from the export sector as recoveries in the domestic economies have lagged. Therefore any risk to the outlook for global trade poses a threat to the strong recovery that has been evident in the Eurozone today.</div><br/>
<div>For example continued strength of the Euro would certainly pose a risk to the recovery. In January the Euro increased from its low of 1.29 (10th of Jan.) to a high of 1.38 (2nd Feb). Credit Suisse has estimated that for each 10% rise in the Euro Dollar exchange GDP declines by 0.8 percentage points.</div><br/>
<div>However one of the biggest risks to the recovery in the Euro area would also be an ECB rate hike. The OECD interlink model predicts that for each 1% in Interest rates would take 0.8 percentage points from growth. However more significantly, the already struggling peripheral countries such as Spain and Ireland would be particularly affected, where household debt is very high and is predominantly based on floating rate. The ECB focuses solely on inflation, and particularly looks at second round inflationary impacts. Currently headline inflation is 2.4% ahead of the ECB’s target, whereas core inflation is 1.1%.</div>
<div>A significant slowdown in the Emerging economies would also pose a threat to the export recovery in the Eurozone.</div><br/>
<div>The ILIM Indexed European Indexed Equity Fund is a straight forward way of getting exposure to European equities. The fund tracks the FTSE Europe ex UK index, with German and French equities accounting for approximately 40% of the index.</div>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[With regime change acting like a contagion across North Africa and the Middle East, Ireland had its own well flagged revolt over the weekend. However, it’s unlikely that Che Guevara type posters and t-shirts with images of Enda Kenny and Eamon Gilmore emblazoned on them will become historical keepsakes.

Much will be expected of the new government not least the prospects of re-negotiating key elements of the EU-IMF bailout package. At this stage it is difficult to foresee what will come of these negotiations but it is becoming increasingly apparent that the current arrangement will pose too great a strain on the public finances and Ireland’s prospects for reasonably strong growth in the years ahead. On the other hand, a less onerous package could facilitate the renewal of strong growth in Ireland. And strong economic growth, coupled with falling unemployment and rising wages will be needed to tackle the bourgeoning problem of arrears in residential mortgages and negative equity.

<strong>Mortgage arrears a growing problem</strong>
The Central Bank of Ireland published the latest data on mortgage arrears and repossessions for the period ended December 2010. The figures show that at the end of December 2010 there were 786,164 private residential mortgage accounts held in Ireland to a value of almost €116.7 billion.

Of these, 44,508 mortgage accounts, or 5.7% of the total residential mortgage accounts, were in arrears for more than 90 days. This compares with 28,603 accounts that were in arrears for more than 90 days at the end of December 2009 or 3.6% of the total mortgage accounts at that time.

<strong>Percent of loan accounts in arrears for more than 90 days</strong>
<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/loanaccountsinarrears.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-415" title="loanaccountsinarrears" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/loanaccountsinarrears.png" alt="" width="441" height="333" /></a>

Furthermore, the data shows that overall mortgage debt outstanding for private residential mortgages decreased by almost €1.7 billion since the fourth quarter of 2009. Irish households are in the process of deleveraging and are increasing their savings and repaying their debts. As we have mentioned in previous commentaries, Irish households have been stockpiling cash and deposits and paying down debts over the last two years, with the actual savings rate hitting an astonishing 12.3% in 2009 or approximately €11 billion. This trend was probably repeated last year, but official numbers won’t be released for a number of months yet.

<strong>Export growth the only show in town at the moment</strong>
While the domestic economy continues to struggle given the austere fiscal measures that have been imposed by past budgets and by the conservative saving and spending habits of Irish consumers, the export sectors continues to grow. This has been underpinned by the improved competitive position of the Irish economy. Also, the fact that Ireland still remains an attractive location for foreign direct investment will play a key part in helping the economy back on a strong path to growth. In this regard it is interesting to note that according to NCB, ‘The 2010 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook, for the key measures influencing foreign direct investments, ranked Ireland;
<ul>
<li>1st for corporate taxes</li>
<li> 4th for the availability of skilled labour</li>
<li> 4th for being open to new ideas</li>
<li> 6th for labour productivity</li>
<li> 7th for the availability of financial skills</li>
<li> 7th for the flexibility and adaptability of people</li>
</ul>
As part of the overall negotiations with the EU-IMF, it is imperative that Enda Kenny and the new government ensure that the 12.5% rate of corporation tax is not in any way compromised. The export side of the economy will lead the recovery, while the domestic will lag and is not expected to drive economic growth in the coming years.

The biggest challenge facing the new government is to turn some of the electoral promises in to jobs and growth in the domestic economy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>The European Courts of Justice (ECJ) &amp; “The Crying Game”</strong>

The ECJ ruling this week means that just like the main character in the movie “The Crying Game” insurers can not tell the difference between a man and a woman!!

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is worth asking, what is discrimination in an insurance context?</span></em>

Is it where everybody gets the same cover for the same price, <strong>regardless</strong> of the statistically proven differences in their risk, or is it where people get the same cover for a different price <strong>because</strong> of the statistically proven differences in their risk??.

In the context of gender at least, the ECJ ruled this week that it is discrimination to charge gender specific premiums regardless of the statistical evidence to back up a difference. In other words, they are happy that those who are higher risk pay lower premiums and hence will be subsidised by lower risk individuals who will pay higher premiums relative to their risk.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Is this a good or a bad thing? </em></span>

Depending on whether you are an apparent winner or loser as a result of this ruling, I guess this will influence your opinion on whether the ruling is the elimination of discrimination or whether it is now introducing a new discrimination against those who currently pay lower premiums.

However, looking around Europe and even within the Irish insurance industry itself we can see that our current view of this discrimination already varies quite considerably. You just have to look at the two Irish examples below to see this:
<ul>
<li>The Irish health insurance market operates on a community rating basis, which basically sees everybody pay the same premium regardless of risk. This is something that society values and closely guards, despite the fact that there is clear evidence of health differences in risk by both gender and age in particular.</li>
<li>The Irish motor insurance &amp; life insurance industry uses gender as an important rating factor which evaluates a customer risk and hence is used in calculating the cost of cover. This has been in place for a long time and is broadly accepted by society as correctly reflecting the approach that the premium a customer is charged should reflect their relative risk.</li>
</ul>
<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The European way:</span></em>

The difference in the use of gender between countries and within countries reflects the evolution of the insurance markets within those countries, the maturity of these markets, the social attitudes &amp; traditions that exist in a country’s society and finally sometimes the deliberate decisions taken by successive governments to use insurance for societal engineering.<br/>
The problem with the ECJ ruling isn’t so much the ruling itself, but the fact that its implementation across the EU is a one size fits all approach &amp; its failure to recognise that each country within the EU is equal but different.

Of course this approach by the EU is nothing new, and reflects a concerted effort to standardise as much as possible across the EU. I am thinking mileage to kilometres, pounds and ounces to grams and kilograms, the battle to ensure that Cadbury’s chocolate could remain as chocolate and even the standards &amp; requirements for cucumbers &amp; bananas!!

In fairness to the EU, the philosophy of the EU Gender Directive is that men &amp; women should be treated equally, which is an approach that the vast majority of people in the EU agree with. However, in this instance the ECJ ruling will have an impact on the efficiency of insurance market.  Removing of the use of gender in the calculation of some insurance products’ premiums leads to the introduction of uncertainty for insurance companies where it didn’t previously exist. As a tried and trusted model including gender made it easier to predict what price was appropriate to cover the overall risk.

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What will be the overall result for customers?</span></em>

As a result of this ruling, the overall cost for insurance at a societal level may rise slightly as all insurers take a more cautious approach to premium setting. How much extra cost, will depend on how confident insurance companies are over the medium to long term with their assumptions about their gender mix.
It is hard to be exactly sure how this will work out. However, the insurance industry is very competitive, so I expect that over the intervening period, between now and when the ruling takes effect in December 2012, that insurers will be working hard to develop solutions that have the least impact on customers. Watch this space.]]></content:encoded>

<title>The economic impact of the oil price spike is manageable for now</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2010-Oil-Burden.jpg"></a>Since the start of the year, oil prices are up 18% in London and while this is a positive for investors with exposure to commodities there is now a fresh wave of concern about the effects of this oil price spike on the global economy and hence hampering the outlook of other asset classes such as emerging market equities, developed market equities, corporate bonds, base metals etc. Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, there has been a positive correlation between oil prices and equity markets. However in recent weeks this relationship has weakened as evident by the chart below.

<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/European-Equities-vs-Oil.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-450 aligncenter" title="European Equities vs Oil" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/European-Equities-vs-Oil.jpg" alt="" width="611" height="263" /></a>

Since the recovery in risky assets since 2009, equity markets have moved up with commodity prices as commodity price rises were seen as a consequence of growth as opposed to a threat to growth. However since events in the Middle East North African region have started to intensify, oil prices have moved higher on concerns that supply of oil will decrease sharply. As a result the relationship positive between equity prices and oil price has broken down.

<strong>The scale of the problem</strong>

The increase in Brent crude prices (crude oil that trades in London) from $100 per barrel to $118 per barrel is as a result of the political situation in the Middle East and North Africa. Goldman Sachs has predicted that to date there has been a partial shutdown of 1.7 million barrels of oil production capacity per day of which 1.5 million barrels per day would have been for exports. This shortage has been increased as the fields that are producing are not exporting crude as the terminals at the coast are not offloading oil into tankers. It is also estimated that OPEC currently holds spare capacity of 2.5-3.0 million barrels per day. Therefore there is enough spare capacity in the system to keep production going, however if the situation in Libya were to intensify or the political unrest were to spread to other countries such as Algeria or Saudi Arabia then this may be at risk.

<strong>The economic consequence of higher oil price</strong>

Historically sharp increases in oil prices have been associated with subsequent recessions or periods of economic weakness. Currently Brent is up 48% over the past twelve months, although historically declines in economic activity have tended to occur when oil has risen by 85-90%. It is worth noting that the oil burden (i.e. the value of oil consumed as a percentage of growth domestic product) is approaching 4%, a level that has been historically associated when oil demand turns negative. Elsewhere the two historical occasions when increases in oil did not lead to US recession was in 1987 and 2009 and in both occasions it was in the earlier stages of the economic cycle and monetary policy was loose. Economic weakness tends to follow and oil price rises when central bank policy is much tighter than it is today.

<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2010-Oil-Burden.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-453" title="2010 Oil Burden" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2010-Oil-Burden.jpg" alt="" width="669" height="309" /></a>

Nevertheless there are a number of considerations to calculate the exact the economic impact of higher oil price on the global economy. Generally it has been estimated that a 10% increase in oil prices may reduce global economic growth by 0.2% per annum over two consecutive years. Personal consumption will be lowered as consumer spending power will decline, business investment decisions will also be delayed as costs are now higher. Certain regions will have a higher exposure to rising oil prices, notable the emerging market region which is by far the world’s largest user of oil. The move today will only have a small impact on the current outlook for the global economy which is expected to grow by around 4.5% in 2011 and 2012.

As a result it appears that the global economy can handle the recent spike in oil prices for the moment, although investors need to be aware of the risks of associated with supply drive oil price spikes. Therefore if the geopolitical events were to move to other oil producing nations or if the Libyan troubles continued for a prolonged period then oil prices could curb the global recovery.

<title>Japanese Earthquake – Impact on financial markets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[It goes without saying that the devastation of the Japanese earthquake and accompanying tsunami is very much a human tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Japan and we can only hope that the ongoing relief operations are successful.

<strong>The following note outlines our thoughts on the economic and financial implications of the earthquake.</strong>

<strong> The earthquake region
</strong>
The Tohoku Pacific Coast of Japan has taken the brunt of the earthquake and the tsunami. The area in general is quite vast and while it is broadly rural in nature it does have a number of important industries located in that area.  However, the industrial heartland in Japan is formed by a band that extends south from Tokyo along the Kanto plane through the Kansai region to the southwest, and to the island of Kyushu and as such much of the Japanese industry was spared the worst of the effects of the earthquake. Nevertheless, there is extensive damage to roads and bridges and huge damage to small ports along the northeast coast of Japan. Furthermore, there is also major damage to electricity production facilities, with the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex being particularly badly damaged.

&#160;

<strong>The initial financial market reaction has been negative equities and positive for government bonds:</strong>

- Japanese equities fell sharply on Monday and Tuesday
<ul>
<li>Topix               -16%</li>
<li>Nikkei 225        -16%</li>
<li>Japanese equity markets have rallied 5% on Wednesday.</li>
</ul>
- Global equity markets have also been adversely affected since Friday’s close
<ul>
<li>DJ Euro-3.4%</li>
<li>S&amp;P 500-1.9%</li>
<li>FTSE 100-3.5%.</li>
</ul>
- Government bond markets have seen a flight to safety
<ul>
<li>Japanese 10-year bond yields: 1.21% versus 1.24% on Friday</li>
<li>German 10-year bond yields: 3.13% versus 3.21% on Friday</li>
<li>US 10-year bond yields: 3.29% versus 3.40% on Friday.</li>
<li>UK 10-year gilt yields: 3.52% versus 3.63% on Friday.</li>
</ul>
- Currencies have been only marginally impacted.

The affected region of the Japanese economy accounts for about 6% of domestic GDP. The Japanese economy is one of the bigger global economies and accounts for approximately 9% of global trade. While the Japanese economy can be expected to contract in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake it should not have a significant impact on the global economy. There should be a reasonable rebound in Japanese growth as the year progresses and rebuilding gathers momentum.

&#160;

<strong>Impact on funds</strong>

Japan accounts for around 8% of the FTSE World index and all of our Flagship funds have less than a 4% allocation to Japanese equities. Our flagship funds are:
<ul>
<li>CORE</li>
<li>Consensus</li>
<li>Protected Consensus Markets fund</li>
</ul>
The earthquake in Japan and the ongoing political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East will make investors very nervous in the short-term. This has been clearly illustrated in the last couple of days by the flight to safety to government bonds and the sell-off in global equity markets. Our flagship funds are very well diversified and will mitigate the worst of the declines in the global equity markets. CORE has an allocation of 50% to global equity markets while the Consensus fund has an allocation of 74%.
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><em>"There should be a reasonable rebound in Japanese growth as the year progresses and rebuilding gathers momentum."</em></h1>
<strong>Outlook</strong>

In general it is still very difficult to forecast exactly what will occur, but assuming that the nuclear problems affecting the Fukushima plant can be contained there is every chance that investor sentiment will recover and global equity markets can recover reasonably quickly. On the other hand, the flight to safety to long-term government bond markets will probably not prove to be sustained and we could see yields actually rising again in the medium term. Global equity market valuations were not particularly stretched prior to the current sell-off, while long-term bond yields were at very low levels prior to the flight to safety. Consequently, it can be reasonably expected that these crisis driven money flows will reverse course in time.

<title>Japanese Equities - a cheap equity market or a value trap</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Given the traumatic events of the past few weeks, it is hard to imagine Japanese equities as being a particularly attractive investment. The fact that there are approximately 50 nuclear power stations located in Japan which, as we have seen to devastating effect, is a very seismologically active part of the world only adds to the risk of investing in Japan. However, based on current valuations, the market does look attractively valued.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>A number of interesting articles in the financial press highlight Japanese equities</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There were a number of interesting articles in the Financial Times over the weekend focusing on Japan. Two are particularly noteworthy in their assessment of the Japanese equity markets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#160;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>"Japanese companies are half as expensive as US companies"</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first one by John Authers in his weekend column highlights the risks but also the opportunity of investing in Japanese stocks today.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0722d6f2-51b1-11e0-888e-00144feab49a.html#ixzz1HEmv9Goo">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0722d6f2-51b1-11e0-888e-00144feab49a.html#ixzz1HEmv9Goo</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Quoting directly from the article:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>“Japan’s litany of problems is well known. Its economy has stagnated for two decades, there is no room for stimulation from easier money, the government has the developed world’s most serious deficit and its population is ageing, suggesting that things are destined to get worse. If you want to live in a country enjoying fast economic growth, you might do better than move to Japan. But none of this precludes the chance that the market is pricing Japan’s stocks too cheaply.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>If we assess value relative to other countries, Japan has been cheap for ages and looks infeasibly so. Judged as a multiple of book value (assets minus liabilities on their balance sheets) Japanese companies are half as expensive as US companies.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Judged by cyclical price/earnings multiples (comparing share prices to the average earnings over the past 10 years), Dylan Grice of Société Générale shows Japanese stocks, at a multiple of 16 for the Topix index, are as cheap as they have been since the late 1960s. (Adjusting for inflation, they were slightly cheaper in 1978.)”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>
</em></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>"Are Japanese companies really worth that much less than everyone else’s companies?"</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The other article was written by Merryn Somerset Webb in the Money section of the FT:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The article again highlights some of the reasons why the Japanese market is attractively valued. A number of quotes stand out in particular.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>“The market is fundamentally cheap in a way that hasn’t been the case since 1989. The price to 10-year reported price/earnings ratio (just a longer term version of the p/e ratio) is at “levels unseen since the early 1970s”. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the same time, Wood points to the fact that the price-to-book ratio on Tokyo’s Topix index is now just below one – <em>"you could buy the lot for less than you’d get flogging their assets in a fire sale."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>"A price-to-book ratio at this level is 40 per cent below the global average. Are Japanese companies really worth that much less than everyone else’s companies? I can’t think that they are."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nor can Mizuho Bank’s Tomochika Kitaoka. This would only be a correct level, he says, if “<em>the very existence of Japan was at risk</em>”. It is not.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Over the last 20 years many a good analyst has stated that now is good time to buy Japanese equities only to see prices fall further.  The following chart illustrates the highs and lows of Japanese equities over the last 40 years, with the last 20 being a near continuous grind lower.</p>

<h6 style="text-align: left;">Source: Bloomberg</h6>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Valuation looks compelling but…</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite the devastating impact of the earthquake and tsunami on Japan and the significant economic and structural problems facing the economy, the current valuation of the local equity market does look compelling. However, it still remains a market with high level of attendant risks, not least of which is the battle to contain the fallout from Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. The fact that Japanese official rates are at rock bottom and with the debt to GDP ratio in and around 200% means that the authorities have little conventional room for manoeuvre in terms of economic stimulus. Having said all that, for equity markets to be cheap, there has to be a reason and Japan has many.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A simple way of investing in Japanese equities is via the Irish Life Indexed Japan Equity fund which tracks the FTSE Japan Index, which is a high risk fund on our risk scale. Like all higher risk investments, such as country and sector equity funds for example, they should only form a small part of a well diversified portfolio as many things can go wrong and volatility can be very high.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nevertheless, I will leave the last word to Warren Buffett when he stated in a recent interview: <em>“If I owned Japanese stocks, I would certainly not be selling them because of the events of the past 10 days or so. Something out of the blue like this, an extraordinary event, really creates a buying opportunity.” </em></p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Mid Season Assessment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We've just passed the mid point in this year’s league and so far so good from a refereeing point of view.

I’ve taken charge of three games so far. The Dublin-Cork game was a very open game played at moderate intensity whereas the Cork-Monaghan &amp; Down-Monaghan encounters were tighter in nature &amp; played at high intensity.  All three games were played in a very good spirit with some excellent passages of play and some great scores.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"There are always decisions in every game that play on your mind afterwards"</strong></p>
It’s been interesting getting used to the new self-assessment system.  I’d usually spend an hour or so on the evening of the game or the next morning being as honest about my own performance as I can.  There are always decisions in every game that play on your mind afterwards:
<ul>
<li> should I have booked for that trip or was I right to consider it unintentional?</li>
<li>was that a high tackle or was it clumsy because of the height difference between the two players?</li>
<li>was there a pick-up in the build-up to that score or was the ball just off the ground?</li>
</ul>
Comparing my self assessments with my independent assessments from the first two games in this year’s league, I have definitely been harder on myself than the two assessors.  A lot has been said in the early part of the league about referees ‘reffing games for the assessor in the stand’.  As a referee, from the moment you throw up that first football to start the game, the assessor is the last person on your mind.  You’re just trying to referee the game to the best of your ability, full stop!

As has been the case in recent years, we have seen a small number of incidents being referred back to the referee for further adjudication.  While referees would probably prefer not to get that email including the line ‘David, a chara, are you happy that you adjudicated appropriately on incident X in the attached video?’, it’s part of the current disciplinary process and referees accept that.  No referee is pressurized into a particular response.  He is only asked to consider the clip in the context of the current playing rules of the game.  In the same way as referees are not thinking about assessors during a game, referees are not considering potential future appointments when deciding on the answer to the question above.  Referees at inter-county level have too much integrity to fall into these ‘traps’.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"Some of the comments directed towards the referee were over the top"</strong></p>
I decided to go to the Dublin-Mayo game at the weekend as a neutral observer.  When I do get the odd chance to go to a game as a neutral, I find myself looking at the referee and his performance as much if not more than the game itself.  It was an amazing game in that Dublin looked like they were going to run away with it in the first 20 minutes but then Mayo fought back and made it a tight, tense last 15-20 minutes.  Sitting in the crowd there wasn't a word about the referee in the first 20 minutes but once the game got tighter, every decision he made was closely scrutinized by spectators.  People can get very worked up when it comes to sport and supporting their own team but some times this does spill over.  Some of the comments directed towards the referee were over the top, particularly when people don’t know the rules the referee is actually penalizing players for.  I think it’s always interesting to compare players &amp; spectators reactions to refereeing decisions.  The vast majority of the time players reactions will show that they know they fouled &amp; accept the decision but because spectators only see one side, the referee is usually the one deemed to be in the wrong.  I know this is part and parcel of the game, but only if it doesn't spill over!  The referee is an amateur who gives as much commitment and dedication to the GAA as players do.

Round 6 in two weeks time.  Refereeing Tyrone-Kildare in Omagh.  I’m expecting another high intensity clash.  Both teams are fighting for promotion to division 1.

<title>EU Policy is managing to create a two tiered periphery </title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The spread of the yield between German government bond yields and the  yields of Ireland, Greece and Portugal moved out to record levels last  week and markets became more concerned about the sustainability of the  debt burdens in these countries. It also now appears likely that it is  only a matter of time before Portugal receives funding from the EFSF  (European Financial Stability Fund) and the IMF.

In contrast to previous crisis i.e. when Ireland and Greece accepted  assistance from Europe and the IMF, Spanish and Italian bonds have  continued to make gains, while the Euro has also remained strong. This  raises the question has to whether European policy makers have been  successful in containing the contagion of the debt crisis.
<div><dl id="attachment_516"> <dt><img title="10 Year Government Bond Yield" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/10-year-govt-bond-yield1.png" alt="10 Year Government Bond Yield" width="591" height="328" /></dt> <dd>Source: factset</dd> </dl></div>
<strong>What was agreed?</strong>

The EU council meeting on March 11<sup>th</sup> surprised the market by agreeing on their resolutions to the sovereign crisis ahead of the meeting on March 24/25<sup>th</sup>. The following adjustments have been agreed:
<ul>
<li>Increased      the EFSF back to €490bn that had previously been  agreed in June 2010 from      the €250bn that it had been decreased to  in August 2010, ensuring that      there are now enough funds available  to cover the financial needs of      Spain, if it were to require  assistance.</li>
<li>Extended      the duration of the Greece’s borrowing from the EFSF  from 3 years to 7.5      years (in line with the Irish agreement).</li>
<li>Decreased      the interest rate that Greece had to pay on the debt by 1%.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Last week the EU Council agreed the following</strong>
<ul>
<li>Agreed      a permanent mechanism which will exist after 2013 called  the ESM (European      Stability Mechanism). This will be €700bn of  funds that will be available      to countries that require assistance.  The fund will seek a triple A credit      rating. It is also worth  noting that the creation of the ESM is not cut in      stone as it does  require ratification from each member state. Also      countries who are  receiving assistance under the ESM programme can      restructure their  debts, which is not currently available under the EFSF      structure.</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>

<strong>What remains to be agreed?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Although      the EU Council members agreed to increase the EFSF  fund, the details of      how the expansion will take place was not  agreed. Further agreement on      this should be reached at the next  Council meeting in June and this will      be after the Finish elections  which may have been a stumbling block for      the delay.</li>
<li>There      was no deal made on the interest rate charged to Ireland,  although there      were some comments from Taoiseach Enda Kenny and  the German Chancellor      Merkel that a compromise on the corporate tax  rate may be found. This will      be negotiated in April after the  stress tests have been conducted on the      Irish banks.</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>

<strong>Containing Portugal’s funding crisis? </strong>

Despite the political turmoil in Portugal last week, Portugal may  have no option but to accept support from the EFSF and the IMF,  especially considering the acute liquidity pressures that it will come  under over the next three months. Prime Minister Socrates resigned after  the parliament rejected proposes additional austerity measures.  Although it now appears likely that an election will occur in May,  Portugal has a €4bn bond maturing in April and therefore it is unlikely  that it will have the luxury of a government in place before it is  forced to accept assistance to meet this maturity.

As EU council members have agreed to extend the amount available from  the EFSF to €490bn, markets are assured that there is enough funds  available to countries that require it. Therefore the contagion from  Portugal entering the fund has been much lower than what was experienced  with Ireland and Greece crises.

There is no doubt that the significant change of political will in  Europe to deal with the sovereign crisis has resulted in confidence that  the Euro will survive as a currency and has also stemmed the contagion  into the larger economies such as Spain, Belgium and Italy. However  questions remain as to whether the efforts taken to date adequately deal  with the bigger issues that are facing the periphery. For example what  will happen to Greece’s debt burden after 2013 as the debt trajectory  continues to look unsustainable, or how the Irish banking system will  repay the €150bn Euros that it owes to either the ECB or the Irish  Central Bank. Also Spain cannot afford to make an mistake and although  its debt trajectory appears sustainable and it’s fiscal consolidation is  on track, the saving banks or Cajas do require a more meaningful  recapitalisation, which to date has been pushed aside by both Europe and  the Spanish Central Bank.

Furthermore, the political will of the core countries to continue to  support the periphery also remains a major risk, particularly after  Chancellor Merkel’s election loss in Bavaria over the week end. Also  there is an election in Finland in April, where anti-euro party is  currently gaining support.

While policy makers have been successful for now in calming markets.  To date the response has been about providing liquidity support to countries  at a high rate. Policy makers have also attempted to deal with the  competitiveness of the peripherals countries. However no response has  been considered to deal with the solvency of countries, which is core to  solving the problem.]]></content:encoded>

<title>The need to hedge – inflation on the prowl</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Cash is currently the asset class of choice for Irish investors. Irish households have in excess of €100 billion sitting in cash and the personal savings ratio is running at around 13% or €12.2 billion per annum. Of this, some of it may be used to pay off debts and some may be used to increase savings.

The decision to remain in cash throughout 2009 and 2010 hasn't been an altogether bad one as real returns of 8% and 4% were achievable. However, there was a significant opportunity cost, with global equity markets rallying by approximately 90% (based on the FTSE World Index) from their lows over that period.

This decision to hold such huge levels of cash is understandable given the uncertainty in the domestic economy and the shock of the credit crisis that saw financial markets collapse in 2008. However, it is unlikely that savers and investors will switch 100% from cash into higher risk products. Nevertheless, with inflation risks mounting and other asset classes continuing to outperform, a shift to real financial assets may be warranted

Consumer prices fell by an average of 4.5 % in 2009 and with deposit rates running at around 3% to 4%, this meant that the real return for sitting on cash in 2009 was around 8%. Consequently, getting a risk free real return of approximately 8% was very attractive for the risk adverse Irish saver. Unfortunately, this type of real return is an exception and is unlikely to be repeated again.

<strong>Money is not what it used to be</strong>

<strong> </strong>Irish inflation is currently running at over 2% and the expectation is that it will increase further as the year progresses. To highlight the impact of inflation it is worth considering the purchasing power of €1 over different time periods. According to the CSO, the purchasing power fell by 25% in the 10-years to 2010 and by 64% in the 20-years to 2010 and by a massive 240% in the intervening 30 years. In fact, according to the CSO, €1 in 1940 is now equivalent to over €44 in today’s money. The reduced purchasing power of a euro today is all down to inflation, and the only meaningful way to protect against rising inflation is by investing in real financial assets.

For example, the average national price for a pint of stout was €1.90 in 1990 and today it costs €3.96 (an increase of 108%), while a litre of diesel cost €0.68 compared with €1.32 at the end of 2010 (an increase of 94%). It is worth noting that inflation in the last decade was downwardly impacted by two years of significant deflation in 2009 and 2010.

<strong>A litre of diesel up 94% since 1990…</strong>

<strong><a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/diesel.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-530" title="diesel" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/diesel.png" alt="" width="598" height="343" /></a></strong>

<strong>…rashers up 66% and…</strong>

<strong>… most shockingly of all, a pint of stout is up 108% in 20 years</strong>

<strong><a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/stout.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-532" title="stout" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/stout.png" alt="" width="583" height="348" /></a></strong>

<strong>Inflation pressures mount………</strong>

According to the CSO, Irish consumer prices in February, as measured by the CPI, increased by 0.9% in the month. This compares to an increase of 0.4% recorded in February of last year. Prices on average, as measured by the CPI, were 2.2% higher in February compared with February 2010. As seen above, the impact of rising inflation year after year significantly erodes the purchasing power of money. Consequently while staying in cash might be a good decision in the short-term, longer-term it becomes an increasingly risky proposition.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last Tuesday was obviously a slow GAA news day, the Irish Independent had 2 articles about referees on the same day!

The first article, while not doubting the integrity of a number of referees appointed to referee the crucial Division 2 NFL games last weekend, suggested that the referees in question should not have been appointed because they were affiliated to counties involved in the division.  I was one of the four referees in question,  taking charge of the Tyrone-Kildare clash but as a Meath-man and with Meath due to play Tyrone in the final round, it was inferred that I could be put under pressure to make decisions that could help Meath win that final game and avoid relegation!  The consequence for Tyrone would be to lose out on a potential place in the NFL division 2 final.  If there is no doubting the integrity of the officials concerned, you wonder why the article was actually necessary?
<blockquote><strong>"it was inferred that I could be put under pressure to make decisions that could help Meath win that final game and avoid relegation!"</strong></blockquote>
The second article, which was actually a follow on from a similar article two weeks earlier, concerned a particular referee who hadn’t been appointed to referee for four rounds of the league.  The article suggested this was due to the referee in question, not upgrading a particular incident from a yellow to a red card offence upon receipt of the CCCC video clip of the incident.  It’s unusual to see some of the media concerned with the lack of appointments a referee is getting at national level that we get two articles over the course of two to three weeks on the same topic.   I have no idea why the referee in question wasn’t appointed for rounds 3-6 inclusive of the NFL, neither article mentioned that the key criteria for appointments by the National Appointments Committee are assessments.  I wouldn’t want the media fighting my corner in this regard, as the articles are more a direct challenge to the CCCC/NAC and the question of trial by video, rather than having any real concern for the referee in question.

As mentioned above, I refereed the Tyrone-Kildare game last weekend.  Tyrone dominated the contest from mid way through the first half and never really looked back.  Kildare are definitely a better side than what they showed last weekend – it was just one of those days when very little went right for them.  The game was moved quite late from Omagh to Dungannon because of the sad death of Ronan Kerr, the 25 year-old PSNI officer, in Omagh the previous evening.  There was a minutes silence prior to throw-in that was impeccably observed by all those present.
<blockquote><strong>"Kildare are definitely a better side than what they showed last weekend - it was just one of those days when very little went right for them"</strong></blockquote>
I’ve now completed my four NFL games and I’ve received my assessments, so there’s no way to change anything now!  My average NFL assessment mark will get a 50% weighting in the ‘actuarial-like’ formula driving inclusion or exclusion from the 15-man championship panel of football referees due to be announced on April 22<sup>nd</sup>.  The other 50% weighting is based on the pre league fitness &amp; written exam results.  The hope is that my overall score is high enough when compared to my colleagues to make the panel.   There are always winners &amp; losers in this process, but all referees accept this is the way forward.  There’s no such thing as ‘favourites’ as the formula is fool-proof.  This was quite clear last year when the referee who had taken charge of the previous season’s Munster football final was excluded from the championship panel as his NFL score didn’t put him into the top 18 (to be reduced to 15 this year I believe).  It was a shock but also a clear signal from the powers that be that no-one is assured of their place on the championship panel!

My involvement in the NFL is not over yet.  I’ve been appointed to act as stand-by referee in the Wicklow-Clare Division 4 clash in Aughrim this weekend.  The match is to be refereed by one of the up and coming new referees who I’ve no doubt will do a great job.  Hopefully I’ll be able to give him a little insight from my refereeing experience to date.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Irish consumer prices for March rose 3% in year-on-year terms</strong>

A risk that we have been highlighting since late last year in our blog and other publications is the risk of inflation taking hold in Ireland. This risk is now materialising with headline rates of inflation accelerating and likely to increase further in the months ahead. The decision by Irish households to hold large swathes of cash on deposit will prove increasingly costly if inflation continues to track higher.

<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/inflationgraphic.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-554" title="inflationgraphic" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/inflationgraphic.png" alt="" width="626" height="402" /></a>

<strong>The latest inflation numbers</strong>

Consumer Prices in March, as measured by the CPI, increased by 0.9% in the month, which is the second consecutive monthly increase of 0.9%. This compares to an increase of 0.1% recorded in March of last year. Prices on average, as measured by the CPI, were 3.0% higher in March compared with March 2010. The annual rate of inflation in Ireland for the last 10 years can be seen in Chart 1. The most striking feature is that inflation has risen from a low of -6.6% to currently stand at 3% in little over a year.

The most notable changes in the year were increases in:
<ul>
<li>Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas &amp; Other Fuels      +12.5%</li>
<li>Miscellaneous Goods &amp; Services                           +7.6%</li>
<li>Communications                                                   +4.1%</li>
<li>Health                                                                  +4.1%</li>
</ul>
Obviously, the impact of rising energy prices is having a very big impact on the level of consumer prices and it can be expected (hoped?) that this rate of price increase will not be sustained. However, inflationary pressures are becoming more widespread and are evident in many other components of the index as can be seen from the following Chart 2.

<strong>Chart 1:    From a low of -6.6% to 3% and rising – inflation is back!</strong>

<strong><a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/irishcpi.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-555" title="irishcpi" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/irishcpi.png" alt="" width="709" height="394" /></a></strong>

<strong>Chart 2: It’s not just energy prices and mortgage costs</strong>

<strong><a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/cpigroups.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-556" title="cpigroups" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/cpigroups.png" alt="" width="703" height="357" /></a></strong>

<strong>Inflation erodes the purchasing power of cash</strong>

As we have often stated, cash is a low risk option in the short-term but it becomes an increasingly risky option as time goes by. The ravages of inflation can destroy the purchasing power of money and the only meaningful way to protect against rising inflation is by having exposure to real financial assets, such as equities, property and commodities amongst others.

With inflationary pressures also mounting on a global basis, the outlook is for rising consumer prices for the year ahead. In our view, the most appropriate asset allocation for a medium to long-term investor who wants to beat inflation is a multi-asset fund rather than a concentrated allocation to one management style or asset class, especially if that asset class is cash or deposits.

<strong>CORE a great stepping stone</strong>

CORE, as a multi-asset fund, is very well diversified and is also capable of benefiting from any rally in global stock markets. The combination of asset classes gives CORE the flexibility to benefit from global growth and also reduces the high levels of volatility associated with equity markets. One of the key reasons that CORE can achieve the combination of similar growth and lower volatility than the average managed fund is because of the allocation to alternatives.

However, given CORE’s allocation to real financial assets, it should also prove to be a very effective hedge against rising inflation. We believe CORE could be a great stepping stone into real financial assets. It has lower volatility than the average managed fund while also delivering similar potential returns over a full investment cycle.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The S&amp;P rating agency surprised markets yesterday (April 18<sup>th</sup> 2011) and announced that it is reviewing the AAA credit rating of the US government debt for a possible downgrade. A negative outlook means that there is now a 33% chance that the S&amp;P will downgrade the US sovereign within the next two years. Considering that in 2011 the government deficit as a percentage of GDP is forecast to be over 10% of GDP with gross debt expected to rise to 72% of GDP in 2011 and potentially reach 85% of GDP by 2016, the debt dynamics are very PIIGSish in nature.

The S&amp;P said that:

<em>“Because the US has relative to its “AAA” peers, what we consider to be very large budget deficits and rising government indebtedness and the path to addressing these are not clear to us, we have revised our outlook on the long-term rating from stable”. </em>

<em> </em>

The rating agency is also concerned about:

<em>“the material risk that US policy makers might not reach an agreement on how to address the medium and long term budgetary challenges by 2013, if an agreement is not reached and meaningful implementation is not begun by then, this would in our (S&amp;P rating agency) view render the US profile meaningfully weaker than that of the peer AAA Sovereigns. </em>

<em> </em>

The catalyst for the negative outlook was the increased risk that there would be no resolution to the “medium term and long term fiscal challenges” facing the US until after the 2012 elections. Once the two political parties put their reduction plans on the table it became clear how difficult the road would be to political convergence. More than two years has passed since the financial crisis and there has been no agreement on how to bring the fiscal position back to a sustainable path.

The market’s immediate response to the announcement was abrupt as major currencies rallied against the dollar, equity markets traded close to 2% lower, and US government bond yields increased, although some of this move was later reversed. In contrast other triple A government bonds such as Germany and UK made gains, while other safe havens, such as gold also rallied.

This move from the S&amp;P comes after the IMF highlighted in its April 2011 World Economic Outlook (published last week) that the risks around advanced economies having such weak sovereign balance sheets could result in much more volatile interest rates. However, the IMF also noted that there was little chance of sudden changes to government bond yields in the short term that the risk would threaten global financial stability.

Elsewhere this week, President Obama is set to deliver his message of a proposed plans to reduce the deficit with a combination of spending cuts and tax increases for the rich. This is Obama’s attempt to block the Republican’s plan that would reduce the deficit by reducing Medicare and spending on education and other social programmes. However it is now becoming more evident that in order to avoid a downgrade of government debt, the administration needs to convince markets that there is a plan to bring the spiralling debt and deficit back to a more sustainable path. This, though, may prove highly problematic given the bi-partisan nature of US politics at the moment.

Ideally, Congress would agree to a credible deficit reduction plan, before the markets start to punish the US government through higher bond yields. This happened in the UK in 2009 as the negative outlook in May 2009 prompted the  UK to implement a package of austere fiscal measures. This reassured the rating agencies and by October 2010 the negative outlook on the UK ratings was removed.

However the political will in the US is less clear cut particularly given the Republican’s majority in congress. The House Republicans passed a budget last week that would reduce the federal deficit by $4.4tln in 10 years with programme cuts alone, however no Democrats voted for the plan. Hopes for a plan were being pushed out until after the Presidential election in 2012, however S&amp;P’s announcement or more importantly markets may not give politicians the luxury of waiting until after the elections.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><span style="color: #000000;">National League review</span></strong>
<blockquote><span style="color: #000000;">Cork showed their strength in depth in the final twenty minutes and picked at Dublin’s lead calmly and confidently, getting ahead when it really counted</span></blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000;">So another national league is over and <span style="font-family: Arial;">Cork have picked up another trophy. It’s amazing how a team that just couldn’t get across that final hurdle for two to three years until last year’s league success, just can’t stop winning games when it really counts.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  The division 1 final was a very open affair.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  Cork showed their strength in depth in the final twenty minutes and picked at </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dublin’s lead calmly and confidently, getting ahead when it really counted.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  Dublin had their chances to at least force extra-time but it just wasn’t to be on the day.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  Both teams will learn a lot from their respective league campaigns as they head into the summer championship and both will have the same goal for the summer season.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  Only time will tell whether either will achieve it.</span></span>

<span style="color: #000000;">If the division 1 final was a very open game, the division 2 final couldn’t have been more different.<span style="font-family: Arial;">  Both teams played with 13 men behind the ball in a very defensive game plan, which resulted in clustered play throughout.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  It’s probably the most difficult type of game to referee.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  Hopefully it’s not the norm for the championship!</span></span>

<strong><span style="color: #000000;">Championship panel</span></strong>

<span style="color: #000000;">The championship panel was announced last Thursday evening.<span style="font-family: Arial;">  My league scores were good enough to make it.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  The football panel again consists of 18 referees.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  There were 3 retirements (&gt;50 years old) from last season so places for three new referees were automatically up for grabs.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  Only 1 of last year’s panel didn’t make it back this year.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  It’s not easy to get that call saying you haven’t made it, especially when it means not refereeing at the highest level for a full championship season.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  However the process again shows that no-one is guaranteed their place on the panel, and as a referee it’s the equivalent of making the final county football or hurling championship panel.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  It’s hugely satisfying.</span></span>
<blockquote><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It’s not easy to get that call saying you haven’t made it, especially when it means not refereeing at the highest level for a full championship season</span></span></blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000;">Two more hurdles to jump before getting ratified to officiate in this year’s championship.<span style="font-family: Arial;">  </span>The championship fitness test on May 6</span><sup><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: small;">th</span></sup><span style="color: #000000;"> and, for my umpires, this year’s formal training &amp; exam takes place on April 30</span><sup><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: small;">th</span></sup><span style="color: #000000;">.<span style="font-family: Arial;">  I need to pass my fitness test and my umpires need to pass their rules exam for my team to remain intact for this year’s championship.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  I’ve seen a draft version of the new umpires training course and it’s very professional and well put together.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  I have no doubt that inter-county umpires will benefit greatly from the overhaul of the training course.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  </span></span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Hopefully the two final hurdles will be cleared and roll on the championship season!</span>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Kate Middleton’s Pension</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The focus of conversation amongst your average Royal Wedding enthusiast will inevitably be Kate Middleton, her dress, the guest list and so on. In our line of business - life cover, pensions, investments - the conversation down the pub might be limited to a Yes/No response to “Do you have a pension at your job?”

The great thing about research is that it can give fantastic perspective on what is actually important to people.

When people think about their futures it’s simply not a conversation starter. That said we’ve come to learn that people do quite a lot of research themselves because it is very important to them personally. People might talk about Kate Middleton looking great but what is important personally is how she got to look that good. People then think - they rarely say out loud - “how can <strong>I</strong> look this good?”.

There are 1,220,000 searches done on google each month for “Kate Middleton”. How many are interested in her diet? Well at the moment it is breaking out on google which means searches about her diet are rocketing. It has been growing rapidly for a few weeks and I’m sure it will be massive over the next few days as hysteria reaches boiling point. Her diet is called the dukan diet, or so I’m told and this graph illustrates search trends on google:

<img class="size-full wp-image-585 alignnone" title="Kate Middleton's Diet on google" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/kmdiet.png" alt="Kate Middleton's Diet on google" width="317" height="228" />

Google knows the stuff that people really search for and therefore stuff they are truly interested in. Interestingly, for the search term “Kate Middleton” it is us Irish who are searching the most:<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/kminterest.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-586" title="Kate middleton interest on google" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/kminterest.png" alt="Kate middleton interest on google" width="968" height="337" /></a>

Let's just compare how often people search for “pension” and how often they search for “wedding dress” in Ireland. 'Pension’ is about 10-20% more popular in the Google world. In the real world people just don’t talk about pensions that much while it’s often hard to stop ‘certain groups of people’ talking about wedding dresses when they get started.

<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/weddingdress.pension.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-587" title="weddingdress &amp; pension searches" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/weddingdress.pension.png" alt="weddingdress &amp; pension searches" width="968" height="204" /></a>

When we look at straightforward research like this it gives us confidence to invest energy and time to build useful research apps for people. They’re clearly looking for it.

Our <a href="http://www.irishlife.ie/advice/pension-calculator.html">pension calculator</a>, our <a title="Life cover calculator" href="http://www.irishlife.ie/advice/life-cover-quote-calculator.html">life cover calculator</a> and <a title="Income protection calculators" href="http://www.irishlife.ie/advice/income-protection-quote-calculator.html">income protection calculators</a> might give people a quote but they also give an understanding of, for example, what is the correct amount of life cover you should have. They are above all built for research. We launched our <a title="pensions calculator" href="http://www.irishlife.ie/advice/pension-calculator.html">pension calculator</a> almost a year ago and each month it is used a by a few thousand people. The proof of the pudding is truly in the eating.

Speaking of pudding, “Royal Wedding Food” is a hot search on Google right now:<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/rwfood.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-588" title="Royal Wedding food" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/rwfood.png" alt="%C" /></a>

<title>Ireland, a fast growing population and the pent up demand for financial products</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[In general, older, better educated, and higher income households will have a greater propensity to hold financial products such as pensions, investments, savings and protection products. However, given the economic crisis of the last number of years, the demand for such financial products by Irish households has faltered. Nevertheless, the underlying demographics still point to the potential of strong growth for financial products in the years ahead and that a considerable amount of pent up demand is occurring at the moment.

<strong>Demographics – Growing Irish population now just entering key buying cohorts</strong>

An expanding population is an important factor that drivers the underlying demand for financial products in any country. The Irish population is expected to grow strongly over the coming decades in contrast to other European countries as illustrated in Figure 1. Based on the forecasts by the United Nations World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision, Ireland will have one of the fastest growing populations in Europe<a href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/t540/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK2A/Weekly%20-%20Ireland%20a%20fast%20growing%20population%200511.doc#_ftn1">[1]</a> and is expected to grow by 11% by 2020, 20% by 2030 and 28% by 2040.

<strong>Figure 1</strong>

<strong>U.N. population growth forecasts for Europe 2010-2040</strong>

<strong>Source: United Nations, Department of Economics and Social Affairs, Population Division (2011). World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision. (Medium-fertility variant).</strong>

Another key factor influencing the purchase of financial products is the age of the underlying population. International evidence indicates, and mirrored by our own customer experience, that age cohorts from around 30 to 60 have the greatest propensity to invest and save. From this perspective, the Irish market offers

significant opportunity as Ireland is still a demographically young country with a significant bulge in the 25 to 45 year age cohorts as can be seen in Figure 2.

<strong>Figure 2</strong>

<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/populationpyramid.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-635" title="populationpyramid" src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/populationpyramid.png" alt="" width="533" height="371" /></a>

<strong>Source: Irish Central Statistics Office, September 2010.</strong>

The 25-45 age cohort accounts for 32.1% of the total population In Ireland and compares very favourably with other European economies. The average for Europe is 27.5%, and in Germany for example, accounts for only 23% of the population<a href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/t540/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK2A/Weekly%20-%20Ireland%20a%20fast%20growing%20population%200511.doc#_ftn1">[2]</a>.

<strong>Pension coverage increases by age</strong>

As the population ages, the level of pension coverage increases and this can be clearly seen in Table 1. While the data relate to only voluntary private pension coverage, there is a clear rising trend of such coverage by age across a number of countries with inherently different pension arrangements. Irrespective of country and inherent pension structure, a definite trend is evident.

<strong>Source: Antolín, P. and E.R. Whitehouse (2009), “Filling the Pension Gap: Coverage and Value of Voluntary Retirement Savings”, Social, Employment and Migration Working Paper No. 69, OECD; OECD analysis of national datasets (Finland and Norway) </strong>

In Ireland for example, voluntary private pension coverage is 27.5 per cent in the 20-24 age cohort and this coverage increases through the age cohorts and peaks at between 64 to 65 per cent in the 35 to 54 age cohorts. Similar patterns are evident in the other countries examined in the paper.

The fact that Ireland still has a bigger than average proportion of its population in the younger age cohorts and the fact that the population is growing means that the demand for pensions, investments and savings, while depressed at the moment, should recover strongly in the years ahead.

<span style="color: #000000;">Jedward and their legion of fans have created phenomenal hype around this years event, the front page of the national newspapers are dominated by the twins this morning, walk through any town or city and count how many “Jedhead” hairstyles or “Quiffs” you spot, the country is gripped in a Jedward fever!!</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"> Jedward are doing their bit to lift the gloom in the country at the moment</span></blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000;">So why the sudden resurgence of interest in the Eurovision?<span style="font-family: Arial;">  As far as I am concerned, the answer is simple, we’re all looking for a good news story, particularly in these dark days, and like them or loath them, you have to admit, Jedward are doing their bit to lift the gloom in the country at the moment.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  Those of us old enough to remember back to the mid to late 80’s will remember the bad times but what will be foremost in our minds are the good news stories, Johnny Logan winning in ‘87 with Hold me Now, Barry McGuigan winning the world title in ’85, Big Jack and the Boys in Green in ’88.</span></span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Fast forward to today, replace Barry McGuigan with Katie Taylor, our big hope for the Olympics in <span style="font-family: Arial;">London next year, for the Irish soccer team, see the </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Leinster rugby team, and hopefully Jedward can take Johnny Logan’s mantle.</span></span>
<blockquote><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">replace Barry McGuigan with Katie Taylor</span></span></blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000;">I think the really positive message in this is that there are good times ahead.<span style="font-family: Arial;">  So maybe Jedward can make their millions after a win on Saturday and BOD’s probably not overly worried about financial planning but while the rest of us might not make the millions we can certainly plan for our own good times.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  It’s never too early to start thinking about your pension, and here at Irish Life we have the tools to help you start planning yours today.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  Why not try our <a href="http://www.irishlife.ie/advice/pension-calculator.html">pension calculator</a> or speak to one of our <a href="http://www.irishlife.ie/advice/arrange-a-financial-advisor-callback.html">Financial Advisors</a> and get the good times rolling for your future today.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  </span></span>

<span style="color: #000000;">We will leave the last word to the boys themselves, straight from their twitter feed this morning…”WE ARE SO EXCITED ARE YOU EXCITED BECAUSE WE ARE EXCITED”</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">OMG, COME ON JEDWARD!!</span>

<title>Robbing Peter to pay Paul</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Colm McCarthy has written a very interesting article in relation to the government’s proposed 0.6% levy on pension funds. The article itself can be found <a title="pension levy - irish economy" href="http://www.irisheconomy.ie/index.php/2011/05/11/the-pension-levy/">here</a>.

In it, he highlights a number of problems with respect to the introduction of the 0.6% levy and the main ones are:

-          The inequitable nature of the levy
-          The lack of regard about the longer-term implications

<strong>Not all’s fair in love and war</strong>
<ul></ul>
Firstly, he highlights the inequitable nature of the levy between public sector pensions and private sector pensions.

‘Around 520,000 people own the €80 billion in these funds, an average of about €154,000 per person. The levy will cost them about €920 per annum on average. About 330,000 employees have entitlements under public service pension arrangements. These schemes are unfunded and thus have no taxable assets, but the total liability has been estimated by the Comptroller and Auditor-General at €108 billion. It follows that the average sum standing to each member in these unfunded schemes is about €327,000, more than double  the amount standing, on average, to those in funded schemes and liable for Mr. Noonan’s levy. The jobs initiative is being funded, in effect, not by those who are fortunate enough to have occupational pensions, but by those who have small occupational pensions. Those with the bigger pensions, public servants in the main, will not be contributing. Interestingly, since the new levy is a levy on assets, it will affect disproportionately the older members of the private sector workforce who have more substantial funds already saved. Younger workers can relax: they have too little in the way of retirements savings at risk.’

<strong>Robbing Peter to pay Paul - intergenerational transfers at work, but not very well</strong>

In another part of the article, Colm McCarthy also makes the pertinent observation that, ‘in March of last year, the government released a document on pensions policy which expressed alarm at the condition of private sector funded pension schemes, including the inadequate level of contributions and limited coverage. The new government has sent a clear signal that it is content to see these problems get worse.’

Examining this point further we can see that there have been a number of changes to the Irish pension system over the last couple of years driven by the fiscal problems facing the economy. While it is entirely understandable why the government is looking for any sources of revenue it can get today, undermining the long-term incentives to fund for pensions is only storing up even bigger fiscal problems in the future.

<strong>Demographic pressures building – Peter and Paul are both not happy</strong>

The Irish economy is getting older and this, combined with the fact that life expectancy is increasing, means that the number of people in the 65+ age cohort is going to increase significantly. In terms of numbers, there will be over 1.4 million people aged 65 and over in 2050 compared with less than 500,000 in 2000. It is obvious that the government in the future will not be able to fund the pension requirements of prospective retirees in the years ahead and individuals will have to rely on their own pension savings.  However, if the incentive for individuals to fund for their own pensions is undermined, people will save less and this will result in significantly lower living standards for future retirees.

<strong>Figure1.          Life expectancy after pensionable age in Ireland, 1958-2050</strong>
<p style="text-align: center;">Women beat men again!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lifeexpectancyandpensionableage.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-657" title="lifeexpectancyandpensionableage" src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lifeexpectancyandpensionableage.png" alt="" width="626" height="384" /></a>Source: <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/59/46/47378113.xls">OECD</a></p>
Figure 1 illustrates clearly that life expectancy for both men and women after the retirement age is increasing in Ireland. For example, in 1971, the life expectancy post retirement age for men was 7.7 years and 9.9 years for women. This increased to 15.1 years and 18.6 years for men and women respectively by 2002 and by 2050 life expectancy is expected to have increased to 20 years for men and 24.2 years for women. One of the consequences of living longer is that the dependency ratio (that is the proportion of the population 65 and over as a percent of the population aged 20-65) will increase from 19% in 2000 to 50% by 2050.

This will be a dramatic change to the structure of the Irish population that we need to be prepared for well in advance. Unfortunately, recent pension policy has turned a blind eye to this, albeit, longer-term problem.

<title>Protection fit for a Queen</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So the historic occasion of the Queen’s visit has almost come to an end.  A tour of the Rock of Cashel, Coolmore Stud and a trip to Cork are last on the itinerary today.

Anyone in the capital during the week will have in some way been inconvenienced by the visit, whether it was delays getting to or from work, having your bag searched as you walked down the street or even simply by not being able to find a bin on O’Connell St to put your rubbish in!!

Over a years work has gone into planning the security for the visit, easily the biggest security operation the country has ever seen, with over 8,000 of our Gardai deployed, and an overall estimated cost of €30 million.
<blockquote>the biggest security operation the country has ever seen, with over 8,000 of our Gardai deployed, and an overall estimated cost of €30 million.</blockquote>
But in my view it was worth it. We have much to be proud of in this county and a lot of it was showcased this week, the GAA, the racing industry, our artists and all with true leadership from our president, Mary McAlesse who has been fantastic all week.  I even had a taxi driver rave about the Queen’s visit yesterday and they, as we all know, are hard to impress!

So the Queen was undoubtedly protected during her time here, but it does raise the question; how much is protection worth to you?  Almost 50% of Irish adults, that’s 1,500,000 of us, have no life cover, nothing in place to look after our loved ones in the event of our death.  A statistic made even more frightening when you consider that in 2010, the average age of deceased for all accidental death claims paid out by Irish Life was only 47!
<blockquote>the average age of deceased for all accidental death claims paid out by Irish Life was only 47!</blockquote>
While we don’t do barriers and thankfully have no need for armed escorts, Irish Life is totally committed to providing excellent protection for our customers.  And it’s not just words, we have paid out more than<a href="http://www.irishlife.ie/guides/guide-to-irish-life-claims-2006-2010.html"> €1 billion</a> in death, specified illness and income protections claims to more than 30,000 Irish families in the last 5 years.

So why not try our <a href="http://www.irishlife.ie/advice/life-cover-quote-calculator.html">Lifecover calculator</a>, or have one of our qualified Financial Advisor’s <a href="http://www.irishlife.ie/advice/arrange-a-financial-advisor-callback.html">call you back</a> and see how we can help you protect your family this week. We know your home is your castle and therefore you’ve a royal family of your own to take care of!!
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>we're in protection season for sure!</em></p>
Now for the US President, we’re in the midst of protection season for sure!

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Security in Dublin City is tight and all this protection has been put in place for the most important person in the world. It’s not irrational to think the visit of Barack Obama to Ireland is influenced mainly by the chance to win some influence over those 12% of Americans who consider themselves of Irish ancestry.  It is true too that he may have just a little more than a passing interest in that small percentage of his own genes that carry Irish roots. Obama, however, is a proud African American and his interest in this small island lies outside threadbare genetics.

“<em>Eleven days and a half gone and I have crossed three thousand miles of the perilous deep. Instead of a democratic government, I am under a monarchical government. Instead of the bright, blue sky of America, I am covered with the soft, grey fog of the Emerald Isle. I breathe, and lo! the chattel [slave] becomes a man. I gaze around in vain for one who will question my equal humanity, claim me as his slave, or offer me an insult.</em>” - Frederick Douglass. “<em>My Bondage and My Freedom”</em>

In the 1800’s Frederick Douglass was a formidable campaigner for African-American freedom and the first black citizen to hold high rank in the U.S. government.  As an infant he was separated from his slave mother – he never knew his white father – and lived with his grandmother on a Maryland plantation. In his late 20’s as a freed slave he went to Europe to further his work for slavery’s abolition. He spent his first 6 months in Ireland.

Ireland had a rejuvenating effect on a jaded Douglass - giving him strength to pursue his dream which he was struggling to achieve in America. During his time in Ireland nobody had such a strong influence or was as inspiring for Douglass as his new friend Daniel O’Connell. O’Connell’s skill as an orator captivated Douglass. Having watched O’Connell speak publicly for the first time he wrote:

“<em>His eloquence came down upon the vast assembly like a summer thunder-shower upon a dusty road”</em>

<em>“It was an example worth emulating.”</em>

Emulate was in fact just what Douglass did and in the years to follow it was O’Connell’s oration style that strongly influenced Douglass. He became a leading figure in America and a powerful orator. It’s not hard to see why today’s US president draws heavily from Douglass and in turn O’Connell, in his own speeches and in his oration style.

When Obama speaks on College green in Dublin City Centre, he will be closer to O’Connell Street than Moneygall and probably closer to the part of Ireland that actually had the biggest influence over his success.

The Irish Life head offices are just a few hundred yards from O’Connell Street. It is here where all of the processing and decisions are made by our Claims Team for protection products such as life insurance. You might think Daniel O’Connell has no influence on anything to do with life insurance but there are parallels. Famously, or rather infamously, in 1815 O’Connell mortally wounded a noted duellist called John D'Esterre. D'Esterre had taken offence to a speech by O’Connell and challenged him to a duel. O’Connell’s conscience was scarred by D'Esterre’s death and for over 30 years until his own death he paid a share of his income to D'Esterre’s widow. She initially declined his offer but consented for the sake of her daughter.

In 2010, Irish Life paid an income to 1256 families, with an average payment of over €65,000. In fact over the last 5 years we have paid over <a href="http://www.irishlife.ie/guides/guide-to-irish-life-claims-2006-2010.html">€1 Billion</a> in protection claims to over 30,000 families. That’s a lot of protection but the most important people in the world are those closest to you. It is our job to make sure them feel secure.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[What a week - if a well known beer company made ideal weeks…

Saturday : Last Saturday was emotional, the proverbial game of two halves. First half we may have fought a bit but nothing was going as planned. Passes going astray, tackles being missed. Second half was just sublime and I wouldn’t mind but we’d lost 4-0 away to Crumlin only 2 weeks ago and here we were turning a 1-0 half time deficit in the return leg into a 4-1 win! Go Malahide United U9's!

After all that excitement it was nice to come home and sit down with the kids and relax watching Leinster (slowly!)warm-up for the Magners.

Monday : Today we’re presenting to all of our Customer Service staff to play back the findings from our Brand Review project in our new Customer Centre. We started working on this over 9 months ago with a wide range of people - our own staff, customers, advisers and our brokers. It’s been a great voyage of re-discovery for everyone. One of the real joys has been spending some time looking through our history - finding out how we were founded in 1939. World War 2 had just started and the country was in financial chaos and yet here we are over 70 years later talking about how much we have to be proud about in Irish Life.

I’ve worked here for over 26 of those years and I can honestly say I’ve never seen everyone more excited about what we’re doing now. Our business is back to the basics - helping people to feel secure and confident about their future so that they can get on with living their lives now - that’s a pretty good place to be.

Wed: Our new Irish Life advertising campaign goes live today. We haven’t made a TV ad for over 4 years, so naturally there’s a lot of interest in it from everyone in the company, which is great. One of the reasons we’re making this ad is that there’s an astounding 1.5 million - yes 1 in 2 Irish adults - that have no life cover of any kind. As the parent of a young family, I really believe the best thing I can do in my working life is to encourage parents to protect their kids’ future by making sure they have life cover.

We made the ad in Ireland over the last few weeks. It would have been much cheaper to make the ad overseas. However we're an Irish company and our customers are Irish - we believe the right thing is to keep the money in our economy and support an Irish production company. And they've done a really great job - it proves once again that we've got really world class companies on our own doorstep.

Before we made the ad, we spoke to a lot of parents, and the one thing they keep saying to us is that as parents we’re to- busy living and taking care of our kids! So if you guys want to get our attention, you have to work to get my attention and really force me to think about it. The prize is that if we do our job and get you to do something about protecting your family, that's actually something that's very very positive for Irish families.

The reality is that over the last 5 years alone we’ve paid out over €1 billion to thousands and thousands of families right across this country. I sleep better at night knowing what a difference that makes to people's lives.

Friday: Every day for the last 2 months my eldest daughter wakes us to tell us how many days are left to her communion. We try to be as enthusiastic as possible but at 5 in the morning , and having had her brother make his communion last year as well, it can be hard to get too excited. However this morning felt a bit different - there’s only 1 sleep left and I’m taking today off to finally give a help at home to get the house ready. And there was the added excitement this morning when communion girl got to hear her name called out on TV3’s Ireland AM. As I type this the girls are singing along to Dora, the grass looks fantastic if I say so myself (although the senior event manager for the communion has hardly noticed!), and there's laughter and screaming coming from the trampoline.

Here’s to some sun and a Leinster/Barca double tomorrow and a Malahide Utd U9 win in our play off on Sunday.  That would probably be the ultimate end to a great few days!]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for posting feedback to my blog. I'm sorry that the current 
ad has upset you and want to explain the background to our campaign.   

As a life assurance company we're in the business of providing life and specified illness cover for parents - paying lump sums to support families if a breadwinner dies, often unexpectedly, or suffers from one of a range of specified serious illnesses. 

We developed this campaign because almost 1 in 2 adults say they have no cover at all and the majority of those with cover have too little to provide real long term financial protection for their family (our average life cover pay out last year was just over €60,000).         

And, because we're dealing literally with matters of life and death, to help in the making of this campaign we got the views of hundreds of parents. Parents overwhelmingly told us that we needed to communicate the real benefits that they feel life cover provides - peace of mind in the present that if anything ever happens to you in the future, that your family will be taken care of financially. 

So our campaign overall has set out to address the following issues: 
    
1. Raise awareness of the need for cover and to highlight the fact that Irish families are under-covered.
2. Promote the fact that cover is very affordable for most families - you can buy new cover from as little as €15 a month.
3. Provide helpful information including a simple guide to life cover and tools on our website such as our simple life cover calculator to make people aware of how they can protect their family and shortly we'll have lifestyle tips from Dr Mark Hamilton showing how people can live healthier lives.   

I'm sorry once again that the campaign has upset you. As a parent and the son of a parent who died very young, I feel I have a personal insight into this issue as well as a professional one. I fully believe that what we're trying to do - make more parents aware of the need to have life cover - is the right thing to do and that, based on our extensive customer research, we have tried to do it in a very appropriate way. 

Thanks again for giving your feedback on my blog.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Karl,

I found this ad upsetting as well, and I don't understand why you chose to sentimentalise such a painful experience in order to sell insurance. I thought it was mawkish, and as someone who is also the child of a parent who died young, I found it distressing and sort of provocative. 

You took a deeply painful, profoundly isolating experience and prettied it up for public consumption in a way that will probably make the small number of young people who are actually affected by this kind of loss feel even less understood. I don't believe that exploiting the experience of parental loss was the only way you could have gotten your message across.

It's great you'll be putting up tips for living more healthy lives on your site. Why not post up resources for kids who are dealing with the loss of a parent as well? Are there any groups in Ireland offering programmes for children who have suffered such a loss? A donation would be a nice gesture, since I suspect your ad is affecting a lot of people you'll never hear from.]]></wp:comment_content>

<title>[UPDATED] A crucial week for the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The debt crisis in Europe has been heating up over the past few weeks, particularly as it has become evident that Greece is not on track to meet the conditions set by the IMF and EU and as a result can no longer receive its funding. The next tranche of funding in due around the end of June and is worth €12bln. Greece needs these funds to continue to pay for its public services but also to repay bond redemption by 20th of July. As a result peripheral bond investors are now pricing in a significant probability of default into the Greek bond market, particularly in the bonds that are maturing in the next year as can be seen in the Chart below. This chart represents the yield on each government bond maturity. 
<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/government-bond-yield.png"><img src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/government-bond-yield.png" alt="" title="government bond yield" width="573" height="354" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-706" /></a>

Although the deadline for paying the fifth tranche over to the Greek government is approaching fast, a consensus about a resolution to this problem seems far away. It has become much more difficult over the past week given the political uncertainty that has increased dramatically in Greece, while the political environment across Europe is also proving a challenge to a resolution. 

Europe &amp; the IMF want Greece to adopt an additional €6bln austerity and continue on with their privatisation programme in exchange for an additional package. The German government also believes that this package should be accompanied by some sort of restructuring of Greece’s debt, most likely offering investors who hold bonds maturing over in the near term the option to exchange these for bonds that will mature in a number of years out. However there are significant difficulties with these options:
<ul>
<li>There is no political consensus in Greece at the moment. There is a vote of confidence in the government today (June 21st) and if the government wins this vote it is expected that the additional austerity package is expected to be voted for. However if the government looses then a general election will have to be held and any austerity package will be delayed. </li>
<li>The ECB does not believe that the Eurozone should allow Greece to restructure its debt now. The banking stress tests are being conducted currently and the results of which are being released during the summer months. Currently the French and German banks have significant exposure to Greek government bonds and no losses have been expected for these positions. Therefore a restructuring could undermine the stability of the Eurozone banking system. Also the ECB is a holder of Greek debt as it had been purchasing peripheral bonds through 2010 in order to help stabilise markets. </li>
<li>The rating agencies have noted that any restructuring of Greece’s debt would be considered a default and hence would be reflected in their rating.</li>
<li>There are still potential contagion effects for the other Eurozone periphery countries, which could result in a much higher cost for the European Union. Although markets have started to differentiate between peripheral countries since the start of this year, a Greek restructuring could undermine the stability of the larger peripheral countries such as Spain, Italy and Belgium. </li>
</ul>


These concerns are reflected in bond markets as can be seen from the chart below. 
<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/pigs-bond-yield.png"><img src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/pigs-bond-yield.png" alt="" title="pigs bond yield" width="576" height="351" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-707" /></a>
There are three issues for Greece in this crisis –
<ul>
<li>Solvency problem whereby debt to GDP is likely to be over 150% </li>
<li>A liquidity problem whereby its deficit to GDP is expected to be 10% of GDP</li>
<li>Eurozone problem – the contagion effects to the rest of Europe and the </li>
European banking system are unknown.</li></ul>



As a result, a solution to this problem is complex. Greece can’t go it alone if it is to keep paying for its public service. It is a political decision by both Europe and the IMF as to what the conditions will be for further funding and currently these look like there is additional austerity and accelerating the privatisation programme. Restructuring of Greece’s debt is also a political decision but the decision is probably restructuring now or later. Therefore the solution to the crisis is political and what ever happens will result in additional volatility for investment markets and will be difficult to predict. 

<em>UPDATE:</em>
The Greek government has secured a vote of confidence last night which will avoid a snap election and increases the likelihood that the government will be able to pass the additional austerity on June 28th. The market reaction has been muted to this news as it was expected and had been priced into markets yesterday (June 21st). Greece's 10 year government bond yield has remained unchanged. Risk aversion has remained evident in markets as the yield on the German 10 year government bond has decreased to 2.96% from 2.98%, while the price of gold, the ultimate safe haven, has continued to move higher. Equity markets in Europe are broadly unchanged this morning following the gains made yesterday. 

While the vote of confidence in the government, eases concerns about the political risks in Greece it is just a hurdle for Greece to receive a second bailout package. The next condition that has been set by EU Finance ministers is that the new fiscal and structural reform measures are agreed. However the long term problem of Greece's unsustainable government debt levels continues.

<title>Who wants to be a Referee?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[After the weekend’s gaelic games, you’d have to wonder who would want to be a referee.

There’s huge broadcast &amp; print media attention on referees at inter county level at the moment and this has been building steadily over the last few years.  There’s no doubt that this puts pressure on referees each weekend during the championship season.  Referees understand that this comes with the territory but what also needs to be understood is that the referee has a split second to make each and every decision in a given match.  He doesn’t have recourse to 5 different camera angles or have the ability to watch 5 replays of the incident.  Referees call it as they see it and this is no different now to any point in the past, it’s just that there are far more cameras and ‘experts’ pouring over each and every decision a referee makes now.
<blockquote>There’s huge broadcast &amp; print media attention on referees at inter county level at the moment and this has been building steadily over the last few years</blockquote>
It’s easy to criticise referees.  Gaelic football has a set of playing rules and whether people have problems with those rules or not, the referee’s job is to implement them honestly and impartially.  I’ve said before that one of the main problems in the GAA is lack of knowledge of the rules amongst the various parties to the game.  All referees are big enough to take criticism of individual decisions on the basis of erroneous implementation of the playing rules but where criticism is sometimes based on someone’s ‘own’ set of rules which may bear little resemblance to the actual playing rules adopted by the GAA, it can be hard.  What is also difficult to accept is when media criticism becomes a personal attack on a referee. This is cheap and not part of the game.  Each referee has a family and neither the referee nor his family should be subjected to negative personal comments in the media.  This should also be the case for players and their families.
<blockquote>What is also difficult to accept is when media criticism becomes a personal attack on a referee. This is cheap and not part of the game.</blockquote>
GAA referees adopt a professional approach to training and preparation for games. We continually strive to meet high standards and improve performance as the speed and intensity of games increase and the media scrutiny also intensifies. Referees are proud to be volunteers in the GAA.

I refereed the recent Ulster championship match between Armagh and Derry.  It was a very open game of football with both teams using accurate kick passing a lot more than has become the norm in the football championship in recent years.  Unfortunately I picked up a calf injury in the game and although I tried my best to shake it off last week (3 extremely cold bath treatments &amp; a number of physio sessions), my fitness test last Friday didn’t go as well as I needed it to and I had to make the difficult decision to pull out of the Leinster semi final clash between Kildare and Dublin. Although no referee wants to miss championship games through injury, it was the correct decision to pull out as Croke Park offers no hiding places.

This weekend I’m looking forward to refereeing the Munster Final in Killarney – fingers crossed it’ll go well!

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[David,

There are very few sports that I know of where referees give interviews to the media after games. GAA referees usually speak through the head of the National Referees (currently Michael Curley). Mick would contact us to discuss particular/general refereeing matters with us and he would then deal with the media on our behalf. I think this works well. As referees what we need to avoid is a 'backwards &amp; forwards' difference of opinion with the media that is of no benefit to anyone involved in the game.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Jerry, the advantage in gaelic football is a difficult one to consistently get right as a referee. It's a split second judgement call which at times can backfire on the referee. I've often thought about
whether a call back mechanism would help. I wouldn't be in favour of an advantage lasting as long as it does in rugby and our game moves a lot quicker than rugby so it may be difficult to come up with something that can be consistently applied at all levels of the GAA.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[John,

I am previously on record as saying that personally I wouldn't be against the use of video (or other) technology being discussed &amp; considered for gaelic games. But I think it's a bit unfair to tie not using technology into a question of respect for referees as we have little or no say in such matters. It is up to senior GAA management &amp; Congress to decide on such issues on behalf of the Association.

Regards,

David Coldrick]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I can only echo your comments about so called experts or pundits.  The media and in particular TV are getting carried away with themselves and my OPINION is that is may have to do with a ratings war between the 2 broadcasters to see who can drum up the most controversy. In the past forthnight so called experts/ pundits commentators have  criticised referess for making the correct decisions.
(PS: I'd have shown Red to Donaghy - I made that remark in work this week and the reply I got was that it was soft but the same argument has to be made it's not the referee's fault if it's soft or not, A free is a free, A foul is a foul &amp; A stamp or a kick to opponent is red). 
On another issue, Would you welcome the opportunity to give interviews to media after a game?. I think by being restricted in this capacity referees become alienated and this may go some way to explaining why media &amp; supporters are giving ref's such a hard time. Like to know your views on that one.]]></wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I was at the Kerry match on Sunday and thought you did a great job. As a Kerry fan in the terrace right in front of the Donaghy "incident" I thought he was very lucky to just get a yellow. I did laugh when a guy beside us shouted out, when you were speaking to him "give him Galvin's name". Overall you let the game flow and you were very consistent. There were a few times where you played advantage and nothing came of it. Would you like to be able to call play back for the free as in rugby?]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Although Irish bonds continued to make losses last week, as the yield on the ten year Irish government bond increased from 11.3% to 11.7%, the CSO confirmed that the Irish economy is on track to meet the expectations of the government. GDP in the first quarter grew by 1.3% since the fourth quarter of 2010. The report issued by the CSO confirmed that the recovery is very much export led, as has been predicted by almost every commentator.  The domestic economy continued to remain a drag on the economy, contracting by 1.9% during the quarter. 
<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/contributionq1gdp.png"><img src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/contributionq1gdp.png" alt="" title="contributionq1gdp" width="559" height="363" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-746" /></a>

<strong>Looking for spillovers from exports to the domestic economy</strong>
The growth in exports has been remarkable and increased 7.1% in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 2010 and is up 7% over the past year. This implies that the growth in the economy is purely led by the export sector as had been expected given the drags on the domestic economy. Also the multinational sector has also been leading this growth, in particular the pharmaceutical and medical sector. However there has also been a recovery in the traditional sector, with agriculture, forestry &amp; fishing up 4% over the past year, although some of this gain did reverse slightly in the first quarter. The recovery in this sector which tends to be more labour intensive was also evident in the labour market data as employment in the agriculture sector increased during the first quarter. There are initial indications that there may be a spin off from this export recovery to the rest of the economy as investment component of GDP increased in the first quarter by 1.1% despite the continued sharp decline experienced in the construction sector, implying that companies are starting to reinvest in machinery and equipment. Also the labour statistics showed employment gains in six sectors including transport &amp; storage, professional, scientific &amp; technical and administration and support services. 

<strong>Waning business confidence remains a risk</strong>
The outlook for business has slowed since the first quarter as business confidence for both the manufacturing and services sectors has eased but continue to point to growth in these sectors, in line with the slowdown that has been seen in global business confidence surveys. Currently it appears that this slowdown is being partially attributed to the production disruptions as a result of the Japanese natural disaster in March and hence is expected to recover in the second half of 2011. Needless to say, any further slowdown in the global recovery could slow the Irish export led recovery.

<strong>Domestic demand remains in a recession:</strong>
The report continued to show that the domestic economy is struggling as consumer spending and government spending both contracted by close to 2%, confirming that the environment remained exceptionally weak for the consumer in the first quarter. Retail sales have continued to contract in April and the effect of the car scrappage scheme which is due to finish at the end of June continues to fade. Elsewhere consumer confidence has rebounded somewhat albeit from a low level in May as expectations have moved slightly higher. A number of head winds continue to persist for the consumer over the next few months that will delay any material recovery in consumption:
<ul>
<li>Inflation has started to pick up in Ireland and in May was 2.7% higher than a year ago, boosted by higher energy and mortgage costs, even though wages remained pressured</li>
<li>Consumers are expecting increases taxes, mostly likely indirect taxes such as water charges and a property tax. The lack of detail on these charges is dampening confidence and hence spending.</li>
<li>Consumers are continuing to repay the high level of debts that were built up in previous years.</li>
<li>The labour market has also remained fragile as the quarterly national household survey confirmed last week that employment continued to fall in the first quarter albeit by a slower rate than previously.</li>
</ul>
Positive news for the government bond market, EU &amp; IMF is that the economy is growing.  The government has predicted that the economy will grow by 0.8% during 2011. This is the economic growth that is required for the government to meet the targets to continue to receive funding from the EU &amp; IMF. It is essential that Ireland meets this target for 2011 and then set clear and achievable targets for 2012. The current growth target of 2.5% for 2012 currently looks challenging, considering that interest rates will be rising and an additional €3.6bln will be taken out of the economy from the government. But for now the government is on target with its plans.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Disappointing economic data, concerns over the excessive debt levels, the natural disaster in Japan and higher food and energy prices have all hampered the outlook for equity markets recently and resulted in weaker markets. The realisation of risks in this lacklustre economic recovery is going to result in a more volatile period for equity investors; however gains are still likely while the economic recovery is in tact for now.

The economic data, particularly in the US has weakened and as a result has pushed forecasts for economic growth for 2011 back to the forecast that were seen in the fourth quarter 2010.Growth forecasts in Europe have held up remarkably well as the export led recovery in the core Eurozone countries has gained momentum. There are also concerns that some of the emerging market economies may be overheating. 

Despite these concerns the global recovery is on track. The IMF expects global growth of 4.4% in 2011, although weaker growth in the advanced economies is being offset by buoyant growth in the emerging economies. The global recovery is in an early stage, it has started only two years ago, which is short by historical standards. On average since 1980 recoveries have lasted six years. Also the economic environment does not have many excesses that would usually be associated with the late stages of the economic cycle. The labour market is loose, companies continued to have spare capacity, consumers are saving as the saving ratios are at a fifteen year high in the UK and the US. Monetary policy is also very accommodative. As a result we expect that the global economic recovery will continue.

Despite this there are a number of significant risks that will weigh on the magnitude of the economic recovery. Most notably there is a huge debt overhang in advanced economies and deleveraging will continue over the coming years. Governments, including the US, will have no option but to cut down on spending and raise taxes which will be a drag on growth. Elsewhere consumer saving rates will remain high. Therefore it will be up to the consumer in emerging economies and business spending to drive growth. This means that the recovery will be slower than normal but also more volatile than previous recoveries. 

Consequentially earnings growth will be more subdued than seen in recent cycles. Recently earnings revisions for the US and Europe have turned negative implying that the robust levels of earnings growth that had been expected by analysts now appears less realistic. We expect that earnings expectations for 2011 will be revised down further during for the remainder of the year. However we are still optimistic that earnings can grow by about 10% during 2011.

Valuations are also undemanding by historical standards and attractively valued versus other asset classes, most notably government bonds. As a result, the valuation story is likely to support equities at or close to these levels. Although investors must have an appetite for risk as volatility will remain much higher than investors usually experience at this stage in the cycle. All in all, ILIM expects that equity markets can achieve single digit returns in 2011, in line with the earnings growth.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is no such thing as a bad food, just a bad diet..

As part of our campaign to highlight the importance of protecting your family, we’re delighted to have Dr. Mark Hamilton share some practical help and advice on taking care of your health.  As well as being the presenter of RTE’s very popular tv show “Health of the Nation”, Mark is an A&amp;E Doctor and is also the father of two young children – the ideal qualifications to provide some straightforward guidance for parents on protecting your family. 

&#160;

In this clip, Dr. Mark discusses the importance of your diet to your overall health.  He also discusses some of our less appealing habits such as smoking and how to get help to give them up and provides a reminder as to what our weekly alcohol intake limits are.  The key word in this video is balance and we think that’s great as it’s important in all aspects of live in bringing us ‘peace of mind’ which we’re all looking for.

We hope you found this video interesting and remember to come back next week when Dr. Mark will give you some final advice on rest and sleep and how important it can be to help keep you healthy.

<title>The ups and downs of the euro</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Despite the on going sovereign debt crisis in the Euroarea, it might be surprising to know that the currency itself has managed to hold up very well versus the dollar and sterling. However, this has probably more to do with the problems that the U.S. and U.K. economies face rather than any inherent strength in the Euroarea economy. In contrast, the Swiss franc and gold (denominated in euros) have seen significant gains over the past few years, especially as the sovereign debt crisis has escalated.

<strong>The U.S. dollar and sterling offer no safe port in the current credit storm</strong>

The following charts highlight the resilient performance of the euro versus the dollar and sterling. As can be seen:
<ul>
<li>The euro has performed quite strongly versus the U.S. dollar since July of last year, rising in value from US$1.22 to currently stand at US$1.40, a rise of approximately 15%.</li>
<li>Versus sterling, the euro has risen by approximately 7% in value from GB£0.81 in July of last year to currently stand at GBP0.87.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the euro is well above the lows of early 2006 versus both the U.S. dollar and sterling and is an indication that the U.S. and U.K. are not considered safe havens in the current environment.</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/the-euro-v-the-us-dollar.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-792 alignnone" title="the euro v the us dollar" src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/the-euro-v-the-us-dollar.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="289" /></a><a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/euro-v-sterling.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-794 alignnone" title="euro v sterling" src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/euro-v-sterling.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="289" /></a>

<strong>The ultimate safe havens – the Swiss franc and gold</strong>

In contrast to the U.S. dollar and sterling, the Swiss franc and gold have offered considerable protection against the sovereign debt crisis in the Euroarea. Both the Swiss franc and gold have performed very strongly in recent years as can be seen in the following charts.
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The euro has fallen in value quite significantly versus the Swiss franc from just under CHF1.70 at the end of 2007 to CHF1.12 at the moment, a fall of approximately 35%. While many commentators believe that the Swiss franc is overvalued versus the euro, there does not appear to be any immediate sign that the fall in the euro versus the Swiss franc is about to end.</li>
<li>The price of gold has proven to be an excellent investment over the last five years driven by number of factors, including fears of inflation, demand from emerging markets and as a hedge against the current credit crisis. In euro terms, the price of gold has nearly tripled since 2006, rising from just over €400 an once to just under €1,200 an ounce.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

In our final video, Dr. Mark gives us some peace of mind with a message on the importance of a good night’s rest. How many hours should you be getting every night? He signs off with a reminder to make sure to get things checked out if we ever have any concerns about our health and not to leave it too late.

We hope you found Dr Mark’s video’s interesting and keep checking in on our blog for information on keeping your finances healthy also.

<title>The consequences of a booming Ireland</title>
<link>http://blog.irishlife.ie/infocus-market-updates/the-consequences-of-a-booming-ireland/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[&#160;

<span style="color: #000000;">Ireland’s population continued to grow strongly from 2006 to 2011, mainly due to a high number of births. According to the 2011 Census, the total population was 4,581,269, an increase of 341,421 (8.1 per cent over the past five years) on the 2006 Census. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Irishpopulation-graph.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-845" title="Irishpopulation graph" src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Irishpopulation-graph.jpg" alt="" width="459" height="318" /></a></span>

&#160;

<strong><span style="color: #000000;">High birth rates and falling death rates</span></strong>

<span style="color: #000000;">One part of the Irish economy that continues to boom is the birth rate, with 73,000 births per year between 2006 and 2011, up 20% per year in the period 2002-2006 and 54,000 per year from 1996-2002. And while births have taken off, the death rate has steadily fallen over the years from 42,000 per year in the 1920s to 28,000 per year on average currently. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate is called the natural increase in the population. <span style="font-family: Arial;">Ireland has one of the fastest rates of natural increase in the population compared with our European peers. The rates of natural change per 1,000 population in the European Union was 1.0 in 2007 and 1.2 in 2008. The same rates for </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ireland were 9.8 and 10.4 respectively. Obviously, we are good at something!</span></span>

<strong><span style="color: #000000;">Inward migration surprisingly positive</span></strong>

<span style="color: #000000;">Another factor that has boosted the numbers of people in <span style="font-family: Arial;">Ireland is the level of net migration which has, to some degree, being surprisingly positive over the years 2006-2011. </span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> The number of people entering the country averaged 24,000 per year, or a total of 118,650 between 2006 and 2011. However, it should be noted that unlike the 2002-2006 period, where there was a clear pattern of net inward migration across each of the four years, the pattern over the 2006 to 2011 period is noticeably different. </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ireland continued to experience strong net inward migration for the first half of the latest census period followed by a switch to net outward migration over the second half.</span></span>

<strong><span style="color: #000000;">But the population will age</span></strong>

<span style="color: #000000;">The Irish population, while still growing, is also forecast to get older. This will mean that the amount of people at or close to retirement will increase significantly compared with the number of people in work. As a result, the State’s ability to provide for greater numbers of people retiring in 30 and 40 years time will be significantly reduced. Given this demographic outlook the responsibility to fund for retirement is on the individual through personal and company pensions. Otherwise, a large portion of the population in the years to come will suffer a significant decrease in their living standards.<span style="font-family: Arial;">    </span></span>

 
<span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/irishpoppyramid.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-845" title="Irishpopulation" src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/irishpoppyramid.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="380" /></a></span>

 <strong><span style="color: #000000;">The consequences of a growing population</span></strong>

<span style="color: #000000;">There are a variety of consequences of a growing population, both good and bad which are outlined as follows:</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Growth in the population is a positive factor in the long-term as this will underpin domestic demand. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">This growth adds to the capacity of the overall economy and in more normal economic conditions creates the potential for strong growth. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Given the current state of the economy and the high level of unemployment, a growing population can also put significant pressure on the financial resources of the State.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color: #000000;">While we cannot ignore the extra pressure that population growth may put on the State to provide adequate funding for current and future generations, we can clearly see that it will add to the capacity of the economy and domestic demand. What’s paramount is that as the population ages it will be increasingly up to individuals to fund for their own retirement. </span>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[As web users most of us are aware that most websites track your movements around their site. This is almost always done through <a title="HTTP Cookies explained" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" target="_blank">cookies</a>.  In light of the EU Cookie directive  - which to my knowledge nobody has implemented yet - I was asked to report on the use of cookies across our different websites and web facing applications. While I was doing this it got me thinking … just how extensive is third party ad tracking on the websites that most of us visit every day?

So I visited a number of popular sites in Ireland – including the main news, tv, mobile phone and banking sites. I also visited google, facebook, yahoo, youtube, boards, imdb, and ebay. Using a tool called <a title="Collusion - see who's tracking you on the web" href="http://collusion.toolnes.org" target="_blank">Collusion</a>, which is an addon for the Firefox web browser I was able to build up a startling picture which shows the extent to which my web browsing was being tracked.

<img class="size-full wp-image-864 alignnone" title="tracking-cookies-collusion" src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tracking-cookies-collusion.jpg" alt="map illustrating web tracking" width="505" height="401" />

<em><em>Courtesy of Collusion (<a title="blocked::http://collusion.toolnes.org/" href="http://collusion.toolnes.org/">http://collusion.toolnes.org</a>) and Privacychoice.org</em>
</em>

The red dots indicate websites which set tracking cookies - as confirmed by <a href="http://privacychoice.org/">privacychoice.org</a>. The grey dots are not advertisers but they could be collecting data about your movements. Most of these would be standard traffic measuring tracking - what are the popular pages, how long are people on the site and so forth.

Based on my browsing the organisations doing the most tracking - denoted by the big red dots are:

1. doubleclick - owned by Google, was tracking me across all of these sites:

<h2>Why are they doing this?</h2>
The advertisers claim they do this so that they can target you with more relevant ads and more relevant content based on what you have been browsing.

The websites make money each time you click an ad.

Therefore, if the ad is more relevant to me and what I’m interested in, I’m more likely to click on it.
<h2>A free lunch … but with a cost?</h2>
Most of these sites provide their content free of charge. Independent.ie, irishtimes.com, rte, breakingnews.ie and most of the big UK newspapers and broadcasters are all free for anyone to use.

You may think that this is great – we get all these free websites and loads of up to date content. But there's a saying which exposes the reality of whats happening:
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“If you’re not paying for it, you’re not the customer; you’re the product being sold”</em></p>
Everyone loves and wants free stuff but they rarely question what it means. For websites it means you're being sold by websites to advertisers. All your browsing habits - your favourite sites, content you view, ads you click, things you search for, what day of the week and time of day you visit various sites – is all being collected.
<h2>Can I stop this from happening?</h2>
Does the extent of web tracking surprise you? Want to do something about it? The EU already has - they've issued a directive. There’s some information about it on <a title="EU cookie directive on dataprotection.ie" href="http://www.dataprotection.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=1152&amp;ad=1#6" target="_blank">dataprotection.ie</a> and <a title="EU cookie directive on ico.gov.uk" href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications.aspx" target="_blank">ico.gov.uk</a>. The upshot is that websites will have to tell you what they are tracking and get your permission on your arrival at the website.

All modern browsers have settings that can allow or block different types of cookies and other tracking mechanisms. In order to do this you need to get in and  navigate around the security and privacy settings on your web browser. There's plenty of resources on the web to show you how to do this.

If you use Firefox there's an add-on called Adblock Plus which blocks ads from being displayed and advertisers from tracking your movements.

Google Chrome has an ‘Incognito’ mode which creates a private browing experience by blocking all cookies.
<h2>Is regulation on the Internet good or bad?</h2>
In closing, these directives and rules that are being introduced are a double-edged sword. On one hand, the lack of regulation on the internet has enabled it grow and expand and change at fast pace. On the otherhand, having more regulation does benefit the consumer in terms of transparency, honesty and treating them fairly.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ollie’s catch phrase seems quite an apt description of recent events ranging from the Republican and Democratic spat over the debt ceiling in the U.S., to the lack of leadership in Europe over the sovereign debt crisis in the Euroarea to President Obama’s reaction to the S&amp;P downgrade of the U.S. government debt from the coveted AAA status to the less auspicious AA+. The culmination of all these events has seen significant declines in global stock markets and investors running for safe haven assets (and that includes U.S. Treasuries and the US dollar!). Go figure.

<strong>The U.S. downgrade – what does it mean?</strong>
In reality, the risk of the U.S. actually defaulting on its debt is minimal, as the downgrade has as much to do about politics as it does about the economic strength of the U.S. economy. The S&amp;P stated that “the downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan that Congress and the Administration recently agreed to falls short of what, in our view, would be necessary to stabilize the government’s medium-term debt dynamics”. This is a long way off of the S&amp;P actually stating that they think that there is a material chance that the U.S. could default and is more in the realm of theoretical naval gazing. As Neils Jensen of Absolute Return Partners states, “A U.S. downgrade is, in itself, almost meaningless. A nation that issues debt denominated solely in its own currency and which is in full control of its monetary policy, cannot default unwillingly. Nations default because they run out of foreign currency to service their debt, but the U.S. doesn’t need foreign currency to service its debt.” 

However, the downgrade will add further to the level of uncertainty and fear in global markets and will raise concerns about the credit rating of many other countries. In this volatile situation, risk assets such as equities and corporate bonds will exhibit marked volatility and on balance will probably end up lower over the months ahead. Somewhat perversely, the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasuries will probably benefit as safe haven assets as will other safe haven currencies such as the Swiss franc. 

<strong>Global equity markets – hit hard</strong>
Global equity markets have been hit hard with falls ranging from 3% to 5% on Monday, on top of sizeable declines over the preceding week. In year to date terms, European and Asian equity markets have seen pronounced falls, in the region of 10% to 20%, while the U.S. equity markets have seen more modest declines. 

The size of the declines in Europe has improved the valuation of the European equity markets with the price-to-earnings ratio for the MSCI Europe index now around 10x trailing earnings. This valuation is reasonably tempting as it is below its long-term average but is still higher than the lows reached in the depths of the 2008 crisis. There is value in the market but there is every chance that the markets will get cheaper before they recover. 

<strong>

<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/europe-price-to-earnings.png"><img src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/europe-price-to-earnings.png" alt="" title="europe-price-to-earnings" width="550" height="333" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884" /></a>
<strong>The dollar is our currency but your problem</strong>
The downgrade of the U.S. government debt could have a significant impact on Europe as the U.K. and France have fiscal problems on a par with the U.S. If these countries see their ratings downgraded it would worsen the sovereign debt crisis in the Euroarea. However, this might force the hands of the European politicians to tackle the problems of the Euroarea in a more meaningful fashion. Nevertheless, the reaction of markets would be quite negative until they see the policy response from the Euroarea governments and the ECB.

It does appear that recent events will ensure to keep monetary policy very expansionary in the U.S. and the Euroarea. That is, short term interest rates should remain lower for longer and the ECB may well even consider reversing course and cut rates again if the Euroarea economy stalls over the months ahead. Low interest rates would be particularly helpful to Irish households on tracker and variable rate mortgages, but a slowing global economy would not be much help to our export sector.

<strong>Summary</strong>
The events of the last week might just force the hands of politicians on both sides of the Atlantic to take meaningful and concrete action to solve the sovereign debt crisis. However, markets will take a large degree of convincing and ongoing volatility over the months ahead seems likely. Equity market valuations are improving but will probably improve further over the short to medium term but given the large amounts of cash Irish investors have built up over the last number of years, the next three to six months could provide some significant buying opportunities.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Global markets continue to convulse due to fears over the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the prospect of a double dip recession. A quick survey of global headlines in recent days clearly highlights the level of fear and uncertainty that is prevalent. A few of the more eye catching include:
<ul>
<li>The chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank AG, Josef Ackermann, said market conditions remind him of late 2008</li>
<li>Christine Lagarde, the newly appointed IMF chief (and the recent French finance minister) stated that European banks need "urgent recapitalization" to stop the spread of the Eurozone’s sovereign and financial crisis</li>
<li>On going speculation that a number of European banks are under significant funding pressure</li>
<li>Greek government bonds continue to be shunned with 10-year yields close to 20% and 1 year yields at a whopping 88% </li>
<li>The German stock market (the Dax) is down 24.9% so far this year, and dropped by nearly 6% on Monday the 5th of September</li>
<li>Chancellor Merkel lost another by election in Germany</li>
<li>The Swiss are starting to hate the safe haven tag with the Swiss National Bank (SNB) announcing that they will do everything in their powers to prevent the Swiss franc from appreciating further. In fairly blunt terms, the SNB stated that it is "aiming for a substantial and sustained weakening of the Swiss franc. With immediate effect, it will no longer tolerate a EUR/CHF exchange rate below one Swiss franc twenty. The SNB will enforce this minimum rate with the utmost determination. It is prepared to purchase foreign exchange in unlimited quantities."</li>
<li>U.S. 10 year bond yields are at 60-year lows and hit 1.91% at one stage during the week while German government 10-year bond yields hit their lowest ever at 1.81%. </li>


The idea of living in interesting times might be appealing to some but for investors and savers the current environment holds little attraction. Also, business and manufacturing confidence across the globe has been eroded in the last number of months as can be seen in the following charts.

<strong>U.S. manufacturing confidence – peaked early in 2011</strong>
<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/us-manufacturing.png"><img src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/us-manufacturing.png" alt="" title="us-manufacturing" width="550" height="361" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903" /></a>

<strong>U.K. manufacturing confidence – has clearly peaked as well</strong>
<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/uk-manufacturing.png"><img src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/uk-manufacturing.png" alt="" title="uk-manufacturing" width="556" height="374" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904" /></a>

<strong>German manufacturing confidence – the export engine is also faltering</strong>
<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/german-manufacturing.png"><img src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/german-manufacturing.png" alt="" title="german-manufacturing" width="560" height="375" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905" /></a>

All of these confidence indicators are finely balanced between contraction and expansion and while they still signal growth, (albeit very sluggish growth), the obvious risk is that many of the developed economies will slip back into recession. Europe is at the greatest risk of recession, which is no great surprise given the fiscal austerity measures being implemented across the periphery and the unfortunate decision by the ECB to tighten monetary policy earlier in the year.  

<strong>What is to be done? </strong>
Martin Wolf, as ever, has a very insightful article in the FT and can be found <a title="ft article" href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/9cbe577a-d872-11e0-8f0a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1XB3mAinZ">here</a>

The article in essence argues that governments that can access cheap funding in the global bond markets should borrow to invest in the infrastructure and productive capacity of their underlying economies, while at the same time setting out coherent policies to reign in government spending in the long-term. Countries like Ireland don’t really have this choice as they are locked out of the international bond markets but certainly a recalibration of spending towards capital spending would make sense. 

<strong>Short-term outlook clouded over</strong>
In the short-term, it does look like the global economy will continue to weaken and global equity markets are unlikely to stage any meaningful recovery in the next couple of months. However, many parts of the global equity markets look quite compelling, such as large cap blue chip value companies and many of the emerging equity markets. For the brave, there are opportunities, but these opportunities may well get cheaper and more plentiful before they recover.

1. A wagon used for carrying a band in a parade or procession.
2. A particular activity or cause that has suddenly become fashionable or popular.</blockquote>



With Rugby World Cup 2011 set to kick off in the early hours of Friday morning, the time has come again for all of Ireland’s faithful to jump on board and get behind the boys in green. Forget the disgruntled looks and mumbles from the die-hards, laugh off their tales of trips to the Sportsground in January for an inter-pro, where they put de-icer in the tea on the Clan Terrace; for the next two months (or at least until the 2nd of October) you’re a dyed-in-the-wool rugby supporter.

Needless to say, in order to pull off that uniquely Irish trait of being an instant expert on the latest sporting adventure to involve anything Irish, you need to be armed with some facts and a firm, long held conviction on the topic de-jour. Alas, your task in this instance is complicated by the fact that Rugby World Cup is the only major sporting event where (barring a disaster) Ireland are guaranteed to qualify every time; In this instance the art of blagging requires a little more subtlety than that gleaned from the more traditional Google-Wikipedia-Youtube troika of expert makers.

With this is mind, if you really want to impress you mates, and you’ve finished your dissertation on how Kidney should bring balance to the Irish back-row, or why Ma’a Nonu brings more the All Blacks than Sonny Bill, we’ve dug up the kind of trivia on Ireland’s group C opponents that Ryle Nugent would be proud of;

<em>Ireland V USA - Sunday September 11th, 7.00am </em>

Bryan Habana may have once raced a Cheetah, but when faced with a one-on-one against American winger Takudzwa Ngwenya, the world cup winning springbok found himself <a title="ngwenya vs habana" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZBcb_W4g2A">tackling fresh air</a> in the 2007 tournament. Heineken Cup fans might also remember the Biarritz man <a title="ngwenya vs williams" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2zC4Ha0DDc&amp;feature=related">blitzing</a> Wales and Ospreys flyer Shane Williams to score a 70 metre try in the 2010 Quarter Final. One to watch.

<em>Ireland V Australia - Saturday September 17th, 9.30am</em>

Quade Cooper is set to be one of stars of this World Cup. But the mercurial fly-half may be hoping his triple Olympic champion girlfriend, Stephanie Rice, keeps off Twitter during the tournament. The swimmer got into some *cough* "hot water" for posting a <a title="Stephanie rice homophobic slur" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/swimming/7987049/Stephanie-Rice-faggot-jibe-costs-Australian-swimmer-Jaguar-contract.html">homophobic slur</a> on the service in the aftermath of Australia’s victory over South Africa in last years Tri-nations, a game in which her man came in for some rough treatment. Are you listening Sean O'Brien?

<em>Ireland V Russia - Sunday September 25th, 6.00am</em>

Russia will be making their world cup debut in New Zealand, thanks in no small part to the talents of winger Vasily Artemyev. Sure to be the only man in their squad with a south Dublin accent, the Northampton Saints recruit was educated at Blackrock College, where he played alongside Luke Fitzgerald, even representing Ireland at U19 level while in the Leinster academy. He returned to his native Russia in 2008 and made his debut for the national side in February '09.

<em>Ireland V Italy - Sunday October 2nd, 8.30am</em>

Sure to be among Irelands chief tormentors in Dunedin on the final day of the group stages is Martin Castrogiovanni. The veteran tight-head is a team mate of Geordan Murphy at Leicester Tigers, and you may be surprised to hear that the pair are partners in a <a title="castrogiiovanni restaurant" href="http://www.timorestaurant.co.uk/">restaurant</a> in the town. Among the specialities on the menu at "Timo" are; "Ben Youngs' Spaghetti Lobster", "Pollo alla Toby Flood", and Geordan's own "Cotoletta di Pollo Milanese" - an old Newbridge mothers recipe no doubt...]]></content:encoded>

<strong>1. What will the state pension be in the future?</strong>

The State Pension (Contributory) personal rate for a single person is currently €230.30 per week, or €436.60 per week with an adult dependant allowance.
<ul>
<li>Demographic changes in Ireland, as in countries across the EU, will put pressure on government finances as the cost of state pensions and health care for the elderly increase. Currently in Ireland there are 6 adults of working age for every one adult over 65, but this ratio is predicted to change to 2 to 1 by 2050. (Source: National Pensions Framework 2010).</li>
<li>Steps taken in the past to plan for this demographic change can no longer be relied upon. The National Pensions Reserve Fund was established to help meet costs of social welfare and public service pensions from 2025, but is now being used to make investments in credit institutions and Irish Government securities as directed by the Minister for Finance.  Simply put, you cannot be sure the State will provide you in your old age with the same level of pension income, medical card support or other benefits as are provided currently.</li>
</ul>
<div>

 <strong>2. State Pension age increasing</strong>

Legislation is now in place that will increase the age at which the state pension becomes payable in the future.These changes are happening soon and people need to look now at the impact they will have on their plans for retirement.<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pension-blog-table-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944" title="State pension age increasing" src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pension-blog-table-1.jpg" alt="" width="874" height="144" /></a>Somebody turning 50 this year will not receive the state pension until they are 68.

<strong>3. Life Expectancy</strong>

Life expectancy for those born in Ireland is now 76 years for males and 81 for females (Source: CSO 2009). While increasing life expectancy is a good thing, it is also something your clients need to consider when planning for retirement. If your client’s retirement fund is to last longer your clients will either need to set aside more, or take a lower income each year in retirement.  Your clients retirement savings may need to last for up to 30 years after your clients finish working.

<strong>4. Income Tax Relief</strong>

Income tax relief is still available on contributions made personally to a pension. This may change, but right now relief is available on up to 41% of the contribution for a top rate tax payer, or 20% for a standard rate tax payer. For a higher rate tax payer, this is equivalent to the government topping up your net pension contribution by up to 69%!

<span style="font-size: small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 24px;"><a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pension-table-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954" title="Income tax relief" src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pension-table-2.jpg" alt="" width="861" height="108" /></a></span></span>
In addition to income tax relief on any personal contributions, employer contributions to a Company Pension are also tax deductible and no benefit in kind is appropriated to the employee. No BIK means, no income tax, no PRSA &amp; no USC - potentially around 52%. Pension income in retirement is subject to income tax at your clients highest rate on withdrawal, Universal Social Charge, PRSI (if applicable) and any other charges or levies ("tax") applicable at that time.

<strong>Tax Free Retirement Lump Sum</strong>

Tax free retirement lump sums are still available when taking retirement benefits. Within the pre-existing limits of 25% of the fund or 1.5 times final salary, a lump sum can be taken up to €575,000 before it is subject to marginal rate income tax treatment, as other income would be. The first €200,000 can be taken tax free, with the remaining €375,000 taxed at 20%.
Someone who can take the full lump sum allowance of €575,000 would pay tax of €75,000 and receive €500,000 in their hand. In comparison with someone who retired before 1 January 2011, this has the effect of reducing the lump sum he receives by 13.1%.

<strong>6. Lifecover</strong>
The same income tax relief that applies on pension contributions is also available for Pension Term Assurance, which means cheaper life cover.
For example, a 40 year old self employed male non-smoker taking out €200,000 of life cover to age 65 with indexation and conversion option could choose between a life term cover plan and personal pension life cover.
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pension-table-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954" title="lifecover" src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pension-table-2.jpg" alt="" width="861" height="108" /></a></span></span>
The tax treatment of a lump sum paid out on death is the same for life term cover and pension life cover. In each case the lump sum is subject to inheritance tax, and there is no tax if the lump sum is going to a spouse or registered civil partner.

<strong>7. ARF options for all</strong>
The ARF option has been extended to all members of Defined Contribution company pensions. This means that the ARF option is now available on
<ul>
<li>Members and directors in DC Company Pensions</li>
<li>AVCs for those in DB Company Pensions</li>
<li>5% directors in DB Company Pensions</li>
<li>Personal Pensions</li>
<li>PRSAs</li>
</ul>
Individuals need to consider their options carefully on retirement, and will need advice more than ever in this area. However, the ARF option gives what many individuals want in terms of
<ul>
<li>control over income drawdown</li>
<li>control over investment options</li>
</ul>
<strong>8. Inheritance Planning</strong>

<span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong></strong>Pre-retirement</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">The tax treatment of pension funds on death can result in a tax efficient way of inheritance planning.  A summary of the tax treatment of lump sums paid on death is set out in the table below</span>

<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pension-table-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975" title="Pre-retirement inheritance planning" src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pension-table-3.jpg" alt="Pre-retirement inheritance planning" width="873" height="129" /></a>For children the inheritance tax threshold is €332,084 per child, including any other gifts and inheritance received from parents since 1991.

If a spouses, dependants or children's pension is provided this will be taxed as income.

Company Pensions are subject to a limit on the lump sum death benefit if the member dies while still in the relevant employment.  The lump sum limit is 4 times salary (including any retained benefits), plus a return of their own personal contributions.

This limit on lump sums paid on death does not apply to Company Pensions or PRBs if the member has left the relevant employment, assuming you completed at least two years pensionable service for those leaving employment after 1 June 2002.  Also there is no such limit for PRSAs and Personal Pensions.

<span style="color: #ff9900;">Post-retirement</span>

ARFs, AMRFs and vested-PRSAs are all treated the same on death.  A summary of the tax treatment is set out in the table below.

<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pension-table-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976" title="Post-retirement inheritance planning" src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pension-table-4.jpg" alt="Post-retirement inheritance planning" width="867" height="359" /></a>Amounts passing to a child over 21 are subject to income tax at the 20% standard rate.  This is lower than the current 25% rate for inheritance tax, although the inheritance tax threshold is not available.

<strong>9. Gross Roll-up</strong>

Exit Tax on savings and investment plans is 30%.  DIRT is 27%.  Capital Gains Tax is 25%, with an annual exemption of €1,270. (rates as at 2011)

Pension funds are exempt from Irish income and capital gains taxes (however pension income in retirement is subject to income tax at your clients highest rate on withdrawal, Universal Social Charge, PRSI (if applicable) and any other charges or levies ("tax") applicable at that time).  The impact of the Government Pension Levy will depend on each individual's circumstances.  This will apply at 0.6% of the fund for four years.

<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pension-example.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-977" title="pension-example" src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pension-example.jpg" alt="" width="874" height="142" /></a><strong>10.  Investment</strong>

Pension allow for a wide range of investment options to suit the risk appetite of every client.  This includes investments in equities, bonds, property, commodities, but also deposits, trackers and other secure options.  Different currencies such as Euro, Sterling or Dollar are also available.

<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pension-warning.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-980" title="pension-warning" src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pension-warning.jpg" alt="" width="884" height="42" /></a>Please refer to product booklets for further information.  Pensions are long term savings plans that can only be taken at retirement.  Tax relief is not guaranteed.  Rates are current as at August 2011.  To claim tax relief, your client can apply to their Inspector of Taxes to adjust their tax credits.  Contributions deducted from salary will receive immediate tax relief.

<title>The Italian government bond market – too big to fail, too big to save!</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Eurozone sovereign debt crisis has spread from the smaller and more manageable countries, Ireland, Portugal and Greece to the larger countries of Spain and Italy. 

As can be seen in the chart below the Italian and Spanish government bond yields spiked in July just after the EU leaders announced the second rescue package for Greece. Markets are now focusing the high level of government debt in the Italian economy and whether it is sustainable. However, we would argue that there has been no fundamental change in the Italian situation to justify the yield increase. 

<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/10yrbond.png"><img src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/10yrbond.png" alt="" title="10yrbond" width="578" height="371" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-966" /></a>

<strong>What caused the yield to increase?</strong>
The following catalysts led to a decreased tolerance for holding peripheral government bonds:
<em>The second Greek bailout package totalled approximately €165bln, of which €110bln is coming from the EU/IMF and the remaining €55bln is from the debt exchange programme with  private sector debt holders. This private sector involvement added to the heightened volatility in the European bond markets. </em><em>The rating agencies were also active around this time as Portugal and Ireland were downgraded to junk status which resulted in Portugal been removed from the investment grade government bond indices. Ireland however has continued to have an average credit rating above investment grade and therefore remains in the main indices. </em><em>The economic data for Spain and Italy deteriorated. Business confidence as measured by the PMI slipped below 50 in July indicating that these economies are moving in to a recession.</em><em>Finally the Italian government proposed a new austerity programme for Italy with the aim of bringing the deficit to GDP back to zero by 2014. However, this plan lacked credibility as many of the measures were back loaded and were to be implemented after the next election in 2013. </em>

<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/businessconf.png"><img src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/businessconf.png" alt="" title="businessconf" width="564" height="369" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967" /></a>

<strong>The fundamentals have not changed:</strong>
Italy has two fundamental problems of low growth and a high stock of government debt. Since the 1990s Italy’s debt to GDP has been over 100% and the average growth rate in the Italian economy as been a modest 1%. However, as the chart below shows Italy has been able to reduce its deficit and debt levels even in very low growth environments in the past. 

<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/italiangdp.png"><img src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/italiangdp.png" alt="" title="italiangdp" width="570" height="350" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968" /></a>

In 2011 the European Commission is predicting that Italy will run a primary balance, i.e. its tax revenues will be greater than its expenditure when you exclude interest payments. As a result the austerity measures that have to be taken in Italy are much more manageable than have to be made in some of the other peripheral countries to start to reduce the level of outstanding debt.

The interest expense as a percentage of GDP and as a percentage of total tax revenues has been much higher historically. Nevertheless as the Italian government bond yields rise, the interest expense as a percentage of GDP could move to an unsustainable level.

Elsewhere Italy did not experience the construction related booms that were evident for other economies such as Spain or Ireland. As a result Italy has a relatively low level of private sector debt compared to other countries in Europe.

<strong>Italy is too big to fail!</strong>
Italy is one of the largest bond markets in Europe and it represents approximately 24% of European government bond indices. A default in Italy would be a major systematic event and would lead to large losses for the banking and pension industries in Europe. Therefore the least costly response to this crisis would be to support economies that are in need of liquidity and ring fence Italy. Otherwise, a default in Italy would also have contagion effects to the safer AAA countries in Europe. 

<strong>But markets are reflecting the increased risks for Italy:</strong>
The current concerns for Italy are liquidity ones. To date Italy has completed approximately only 65% of its gross funding requirement for 2011 and therefore will be going to the market every month for the rest of the year. However, the net issuance (issuance minus redemptions) for Italy has been front loaded and the remaining funding requirement is really to repay debt that is maturing and coupon payments. In September Italy has raised €3.9bln in a five year auction, however it had to pay up for this money as the yield was approximately 0.5% higher than money that had been raised previously. 

<strong>ECB intervention has helped underpin the Italian market</strong>
The ECB has been somewhat successful in curbing the spiralling Italian government bond yields by purchasing bonds in the secondary markets. Since the start of August it has purchased approximately €60bln worth of government bonds in distressed markets. However the concerns are that it will be more challenging for the ECB to remain effective particularly given the size of the Italian bond market. Also the ECB is sterilizing the effects of this bond purchasing by taking in deposits from the banking system and therefore is limited in the amount of bonds that it much purchase. Thirdly, it will be difficult for the ECB to keep up with the issuance emanating from Italy for the remainder of the year.

<strong>Liquidity, not solvency, at the heart of the Italian problem</strong>
As a result, the recent volatility in Italian bond markets has increased the liquidity risks for the Italian government. However, unlike Greece we do not think that there is any significant solvency risk for Italy at this stage. Nevertheless, these liquidity risks will be an ongoing source of volatility for European bond markets in the near term and would be exacerbated by political infighting in Italy and concerns about a possible ratings downgrade to Italy. 

However, the fundamentals are unchanged in our view over the past few months and investors would be giving up a significant yield spread by readjusting their portfolios into AAA assets right now, particularly given the risk aversion which is built into the AAA yields.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>There’s only three certainties in life - death, taxes, and the Pensions time bomb!</strong>

We all know about death and taxes so let’s focus on the pensions time-bomb. There are some things about this we know to be absolutely certain;
<ol>
<li>Ireland may be a young country today, but its getting older. There’s 6 of us working for every 1 in retirement today, but by 2050 that ratio will shrink to 2 to 1</li>
<li>We’re also living longer. If you’re lucky enough to be alive at age 65, my actuarial colleagues tell me you’re likely to live for a further 16 to 20 years</li>
<li>The state pension is a valuable benefit, but for most people it’s not enough to live on. Someone earning €60,000 a year can expect a drop in income in retirement of up to 80% if they rely solely on the state pension. And with the pressure on public finances, it’s inevitable that the State pension will erode in real terms, as indeed the age at which it is received has already been extended.</li>
</ol>
Clearly, these three factors combine to create a major funding challenge for Ireland Inc. into the future. However, proper long-term planning in our public policy can make this challenge manageable. That’s if we start planning today, and encouraging people to plan for themselves to reduce the burden on the state has to be part of the solution.

<strong>Planning for the time-bomb</strong>

Quite properly, the Government today is obsessed with the €15bn fiscal adjustment that’s required between now and 2014. However, there’s a real risk that in solving today’s problem we create an even bigger one for the future.

Many of us believe that the seeds of Ireland’s demise were actually sown long before the crash in the prime years of the Celtic Tiger, around 2000 and 2001, when we began to spend money we simply didn’t have.

I genuinely believe we are making the same mistakes today in the area of pensions. Every single policy measure of recent years has been negative, and it’s created a crisis of confidence in pensions. Recent Irish Life customer research indicates that almost one quarter of our customers are considering either reducing or suspending payments in the next 12 months, which also bears out our experience of the past 12 motnhs.

What an appalling vista it would be, if the youth of Ireland who inherited negative equity from the generation before them, were themselves condemned to poverty in retirement.

In the excesses of the Celtic Tiger we had people borrowing money they couldn’t afford to invest in dreams that could never be realised.

Pension customers are different and should be supported. Even in the teeth of recession they are prepared to put something aside today so they can enjoy their retirement and not become a burden on the state.

<strong>Supporting middle Ireland</strong>

For the workers of middle Ireland – 85% of our customers earn less than €70,000 – retirement planning is a noble cause. I believe it is in society’s interest to support these people today in their honest endeavour and their hopes and dreams for the future.

Unfortunately, these middle income workers don’t feel valued today. In a recent Irish Life survey, 70% of middle income workers said they did not believe that the Government was actively trying to encourage people to save for their retirement.

The current Programme for Government sets an objective of rebuilding a broken society. In its introduction it quotes Albert Einstein
<blockquote>‘Learn from yesterday, live for today, and hope for tomorrow’</blockquote>
That’s why I’m calling on Government today to give clarity to the workers of middle Ireland that it will continue to support them in planning for their retirement and allow them to hope for their futures.

<strong>Paying our share</strong>

Of course, the reality is that every section of society has to make a contribution in a time of national crisis. I fully accept that. The plain fact is that the pensions community is being asked to fund about €1bn of the total €15bn fiscal adjustment. That’s a significant adjustment in anyone’s language.

We’ve signed up for this and we’re working with Government to see how we can deliver. However, in addition to this €1bn annual saving, we then had the recent Pensions Levy from which a further €1.8bn contribution is expected over next four years.

The Pensions levy has had such a devastating impact, not just because of the €1.8bn reduction of all our pension funds, but because it has undermined any remaining confidence in retirement planning. Pensions generally – public and private – are long term contracts of trust and it’s incredibly difficult to repair such a breach of trust. It’s the latest in a long line of negative signals that being sensible today is not valued by the state.

Now, I’ve heard many commentators suggest that the Levy was actually originally suggested by the industry, and I’m glad to set the record straight here. The idea of a levy has been around for over 20 years. For example, the Pensions Board is currently funded via a similar levy. It is true that some in the industry, suggested a lower % levy as an alternative to a change in tax relief.

However, the Government has introduced the Levy – not as an alternative as was suggested but as an additional measure with no commitment to retain tax relief at the marginal rate. Effectively, it’s a ‘double whammy’ and completely at odds with what was originally intended.

But that’s history and we need to deal with today.

The simple fact is this. The chronic lack of confidence in future incentives for retirement planning is contributing to a record level of workers stopping paying into their pensions. In turn, this is generating surplus flows to the exchequer over and above those projected in the €15bn National Recovery Plan.

A recent analysis carried out by Milliman Actuarial Consultants has indicated that even if the Government did nothing else in the area of Pensions, it would achieve over 90% of the savings required in 2011 and 2012 in relation to the €940m goal. And that’s before we even consider the levy.

It’s a very significant conclusion so I’ll repeat it – even if the Government introduces no new pension initiatives in the budget it will achieve over 90% of the savings required for 2011 and 2012.

Now, whilst this is good news for the exchequer in the short-term, it’s bad news for us all in the longer term. The Government is relying on workers stopping their pensions and thus increasing tax revenues. That’s going to store up even bigger problems for the Exchequer in the future.

<strong>Reducing pension tax relief is a bad idea</strong>

The recent National Pension Framework recommends reducing pension tax relief to a hybrid rate of 33%. I believe that would be a retrograde step. I think it would be very difficult for most financial planners to recommend to their customers to lock money away for 20 or 30 years at say 33% relief, when they could be taxed at 41% (or more) in retirement. 

There are simply more attractive short-term savings options available and professional advisers would be bound to recommend them. This would not be in the long-term interests of the State and would inevitably impose an increasing burden on the first pillar which is the state pension.

Yes, tax relief at the marginal rate is an attractive incentive, but you need an attractive incentive if you are expected to put your money way for 20 or 30 years. We need to be honest here, when discussing tax relief too many commentators think about Michael Fingleton’s €27m pension pot, rather than the 85% of pension customers who earn €70,000 p.a. or less. These days the marginal tax rate kicks in at €32,800 so reducing tax relief will undoubtedly hit the middle income worker.

So, I would urge the Government to give a commitment to retaining relief at the marginal rate for middle-income workers.

I also agree that we need to do more for lower paid workers and women who have less opportunity to build a pension pot given the more stop / start nature of their working career. We need to be innovative here, and I think some of the ideas contained in the National Pensions Framework can provide the solution.

<strong>Equity in pensions</strong>

We need to ensure that the scarce reliefs are widely available, and not the domain of the few. The State cannot continue to support wealth management type incentives in the current climate and the various measures of recent budgets have quite rightly closed off these loop-holes. However, it’s vital that middle-income workers continue to be given every incentive to plan for their retirement.

We need equity between defined contribution members and defined benefit members. Now, I meet pension trustees every week and I am very sympathetic to the concerns of defined benefit schemes. The recent decision by the trustees of the Tara Mines scheme to cut benefits in retirement by 10% is a devastating blow to the workers involved and is perhaps only a pre-cursor of things to come, particularly once Trustees come to grips with the down-stream impact of the recent Levy.

However, the simple fact is that most defined contribution schemes are equally under-funded. The under-performance of various markets over the past decade and continued low interest rates have left most defined contribution holders significantly under-funded. Most of the public debate centres on defined benefit, but I believe that the needs of defined contribution workers also needs to be addressed.

<strong>The other area of equity is between the private sector and the public sector. </strong>

Now as we know, public sector pensions are funded on a ‘pay as you go’ basis. This represents its very own ‘pensions time-bomb’. A recent review by the Department of Finance indicated that pensions in payment to public servants has grown by around 70% since 2006 from €1.4bn to €2.4bn.

Pensions in payment now represent 16% of the entire public sector wage bill, and there are now 2.5 active public servants for every one in retirement. Within a couple of decades, there’s likely to be more public servants in retirement than working, and serious reform is required here if another fiscal black-hole is to be avoided.

The average retirement income to public servants is €22,500 (not including the social welfare pension). This equates to a fund of approximately €700,000 which is about five times more than the average fund of €150,000 for the private sector worker in a defined contribution scheme.

Now, the Programme for Government proposes a maximum limit of €60,000 p.a. on any public sector pension. And if we are going to have equity between the public and private sectors, then I’m assuming the Government is also proposing a €60,000 limit for the private sector.

However, where pension practitioners do have a problem here is around the basis in which this income is converted into a notional lump sum for defined contribution workers. The current factor of 20 times is nowhere near the market rate. Most of us in this room would love to provide an income in retirement using such a factor, but it’s simply not possible.

A recent independent study conducted for PIBA concluded that for a public servant retiring at age 60, the relevant factor is between 30 to 40 times. That indicates that the current maximum fund threshold of €2.3m may be not far off the mark as to what’s required.

We’re passionate about pensions in Irish Life. For generations, we’ve helped over 1 million middle-income workers plan for a peaceful retirement.

It greatly saddens me that confidence in the future of retirement planning is so low right now. I think it’s in the interests of every one in society that we build collective hope in our shared future. That’s why its vital the Government commits to support middle Ireland to plan for their retirement.

You see, the fundamentals of retirement planning have changed. It’s no longer about what age we can retire at, it’s more than ever about what income we can afford to retire at.

This is our <strong>BIGGEST EVER OFFER</strong>, it’s a major move to highlight the importance for parents to protect their family’s income should they die. Why do we need to highlight this? Well it continues to be a major problem for Irish families when you consider the facts:
<ul>
<li>There are 500,000 Irish families with Children under 13.</li>
<li>60% of parents say that they could not cope financially if one parent died.*</li>
<li>Yet only one in every three families have life cover other than basic mortgage protection.</li>
<li>This leaves around 350,000 Irish Families with insufficient cover.</li>
</ul>
That’s why we are offering €10,000 worth of life insurance to up to 20,000 parents of young families on a first come-first served basis.  The promotion is available through brokers and financial advisers around the country and of course<a href="http://www.irishlife.ie/life-assurance/free-life-insurance-offer.html?utm_source=ilac&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=TTLIG" target="_blank"> right here on our website</a>.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Eurozone sovereign debt crisis has now created a sharp decline in confidence in Euroarea assets and robust action is needed to restore confidence. Concerns are currently centred on the larger economies including Italy and Spain. These economies are seen as too big to save and as a result the outcome of the crisis has become almost binary. Either EU leaders commit every possible resource available to the crisis or the "Euro project" breaks up. We continue to believe that EU leaders will eventually adopt the necessary policies to save the region, a break up of which would certainly come at a much higher cost to all countries and also to the global economy.

<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/eurozonebondspread.png"><img src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/eurozonebondspread.png" alt="" title="eurozonebondspread" width="732" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1114" /></a>

<strong>The Crux of the problem – too much debt</strong>
The problems in the Eurozone are complex and hence the region has been in crisis mode now for eighteen months. The fundamental problem facing the global economy is the high level of debt both public and private in the advanced economies. However the crisis is exploding in the Eurozone and is highlighting the difficulties in having a monetary union without a fiscal union. Although on aggregate the economic indicators in the Eurozone as a whole look
reasonable, we are now well aware that many separate economies have been mismanaged. For example in 2010 the Eurozone as a whole had a deficit to GDP of 6% but this masked the -31% (when you include the banking costs) that Ireland had. Furthermore, Debt to GDP for the region is far lower than for Japan or even the US but obviously Greece now has a debt to GDP of 170%. Within the economies there are also large imbalances as the Eurozone over all
has a balanced current account, masking a substantial deficit in Greece, Portugal and Spain and a surplus in Germany. Prior to 2008, bond markets did not price the risk of these imbalances into debt markets as the spread of Greek government bonds over German
government bonds would have been as low as 0.34%, while other countries spreads would have been even lower. As a result, bond markets allowed the Greek government to mismanage its public sector, financing the build up of excess debt levels. The problems in other countries are different. For example Spain and Ireland have banking and housing crises, while Portugal and Italy have major obstacles to economic growth.

<strong>More and more uncertainty…</strong>
The Eurozone sovereign crisis has being intensifying since July when the EU government leaders agreed to apply a haircut to private sector investors who held Greek government bonds. In doing so EU leaders attached a credit risk to government bonds that did not previously exist. This credit risk has now been priced into markets as the yields of Italian, Spanish and French debt have risen.

Furthermore the latest EU plan that was agreed at the end of October has also increased pressures in the Eurozone debt markets. In particular, European banks are now required to price government bonds at market prices rather than par for the purpose of assessing their capital ratios. This measure has also resulted in large scale selling of bonds that are perceived as risky by markets. As a result banks and insurance companies are no longer
willing to take on the credit risk that has been associated with government bonds in the Eurozone. This has left the limited bond purchasing programme of the ECB as the only buyer in town of Eurozone peripheral debt.

Currently the Eurozone bond purchasing programme differs from that of the "quantitative easing" policies in the UK, the US and Japan because the ECB is required to “sterilize” any money spent on bond purchases. This means the ECB is required to raise money to purchase the bonds by either taking in deposits from the banking system or selling other assets from its books. This limits the amount of government debt that the ECB can purchase. In contrast,
market participants know that the central banks in the UK or the US have an unlimited wallet and are lenders of last resort for UK and US debt.

In addition there is a complete lack of political agreement to deal with the crisis and to date any policy response has been insufficient. Despite numerous efforts, EU leaders have been unable to differentiate the smaller peripherals or even just Greece from the other countries in the region. However leaders in France and Germany have continued to discuss an orderly exit
of Greece from the Euro, which has put the sustainability of the currency into disrepute and intensified the contagion risks.

<strong>The fallout so far</strong>
The economic picture in Europe has deteriorated dramatically since the first half of 2011 when the core countries in Europe were experiencing solid growth. Since August, economic indicators have declined, particularly business confidence for the manufacturing and services sectors which now point to a contraction in these sectors as evidenced by the chart below. As a result many commentators are predicting that the Eurozone economy will move into recession in early 2012.The main question now lies with how deep and how long the recession will be. Most governments in the Eurozone are implementing austerity programs which alone will lead to a much lower growth outlook. However the banking sector is also
paying down its debts and as a result bank lending into the economy will be very weak. Although structural reforms are certainly needed to address the excesses that have built up in
the peripheral countries during the boom times, the pace of overall de-leveraging needs to be addressed in order to stimulate economic growth.

<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/eurozonebusinessonfidence.png"><img src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/eurozonebusinessonfidence.png" alt="" title="eurozonebusinessonfidence" width="723" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1115" /></a>

Stresses are also evident in the financial sector and liquidity is becoming tighter. Banks in the Eurozone are finding it increasingly expensive to borrow money in the wholesale market as is evident from the chart below. This chart shows the difference between what the banks and the government have to pay for three month money underlining that stresses in the Eurozone banking sector have increased, although not to the levels that were seen in 2008 at the time of Lehman’s collapse. The ECB is currently supporting the banking system by providing unlimited liquidity through its three and thirteen month tenders in December. Furthermore five global central banks are also providing dollar funding to the Eurozone banks. However this has still not been enough to sufficiently rebuild confidence so that banks will lend to each other.

<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/threemontheuribor.png"><img src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/threemontheuribor.png" alt="" title="threemontheuribor" width="720" height="498" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1116" /></a>

Volatility for financial markets has increased sharply since August and despite the market rally in October, equity market volatility remains high. Volatility has also increased for bond
markets, most notably last week when the German ten year  government bond yield increased from 1.8% to 2.3% following the failed bond auction earlier in the week. These large swings in both equity and bond markets continue to force investors into safer haven assets.

<strong>How bad can it get?</strong>
The most obvious risk for markets at the moment is that Italy or Spain will be unable to fund themselves next year at current refinancing levels. Italy has a primary surplus i.e. it takes in
more tax revenues than it pays out on expenses when you exclude the payment of interest on its debt. However next year Italy has government debt worth €300bln to repay and has also to pay coupons of approximately €50bln on existing debt. If Italy has to refinance this money at a yield of 7% its debt becomes less sustainable and its debt to GDP ratio could rise to 130% very quickly. Spain, on the other hand, has to raise €250bln to meet its financing needs. Given that banks and insurance companies are shying away from holding Italian and Spanish debt it is difficult to see who will take up this issuance unless the ECB changes its
stance.

<strong>What would solve the crisis?</strong>
<em>Austerity &amp; Reform is essential in the peripheral countries</em>
The external deficits that have built up over the past ten years in the Eurozone can only be addressed through austerity and an internal devaluation because of monetary union. This adjustment will lead to a recession in these regions and also deflation. In order to avoid a recession in the entire region, the countries that have benefited from the improvement in competitiveness need to be the drivers of growth for the region as a whole. As can be seen from the chart below, Germany was successful in improving its competitiveness from 2002 to 2011. As a result the core economies that have not allowed excesses build up in their economies now need to adopt pro growth policies to help offset the weaknesses in the peripheral economies. These adjustments to the peripheral regions will take some time to implement and therefore will not stabilise markets in the near term. However, the rebalancing of the economies in the Eurozone is essential to the longer term stability of the region.

<a href="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/improvedcompetitiveness.png"><img src="http://demoblog.irishlife-ebiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/improvedcompetitiveness.png" alt="" title="improvedcompetitiveness" width="726" height="442" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1117" /></a>

<em>The EFSF fund needs to be reformed</em>
In the shorter term the financing of government debt needs to be resolved. To date the IMF and the EU have established the EFSF fund, which currently has the capacity to raise as much as €440bln for countries in difficulty. Greece, Ireland and Portugal have already committed to this programme and are expected to use approximately €250bln of the funds available. However a programme cannot be offered to Spain and Italy in the same way because the
EFSF does not have the capacity to meet a €600bln financing need for 2012. In the October EU meeting it was proposed that the EFSF fund would be increased to €1tln through a guarantee from the other countries in the region, notably the AAA countries aswell as by raising money from abroad. Since November, it is evident that increasing this fund is unlikely because there has been lacklustre demand for the EFSF particularly as the fund’s €3bln auction at the start of November did not go as well as had been expected. Also the spread of the EFSF bonds over Germany have widened to 1.6% versus 0.55% back in June 2011. It is therefore unlikely that there will be enough interest in the fund as it currently stands. The structure of the EFSF fund may be addressed when the EU council meets on the 9th of December.

<em>ECB quantitative easing will help</em>
Many commentators have agreed that a quantitative easing programme by the ECB, where it prints money and purchases government bonds in the secondary market is now essential as part of any resolution to the crisis. The ECB could do this by announcing that it will purchase a substantial sum of government bonds as has been the case with the Bank of England and Federal Reserve. Alternatively, the ECB could announce that it will keep the Spanish and
Italian government bond yields at a targeted level, which would allow these countries to raise the necessary finance next year at an affordable rate. Either solution would be a positive for
markets. To date Germany in particular has been very much against this idea as printing money creates inflation and currently the only mandate of the ECB is to control inflation. However it could be argued that if countries are adopting the necessary reform policies to remove imbalances in the region that some inflation is needed to offset the deflationary austerity policies. EU policy makers can be more confident in recent weeks that these policies
will be adhered to after the technocrat governments have been implemented in Greece and Italy. Although deadlock remains on the possibility of ECB purchasing bonds for now it is acknowledged that private sector outflows must be replaced in order to keep governments running next year.

Some solutions being explored is that the ECB lends money to the IMF with the IMF subsequently distributing the money to the Eurozone countries requiring assistance on condition that the recipient countries undertake prescribed austerity measures.

<em>A Eurobond may be a solution in the longer term</em>
The idea of a central financing mechanism for the Eurozone is also being explored but similarly to the structural reforms it will be a longer term solution to the crisis and would greatly address the crux of the problem by supporting the monetary union with a fiscal union. This solution would make it easier for the ECB to be lender of last resort for the system as it would not have the dilemma of which countries’ bonds should be purchased vis a vis others.
However a Eurobond would require much greater fiscal unity than currently exists and major social, economic and policy hurdles would have to be overcome to achieve this.

<em>A break up of the Eurozone</em>
Although there is a lot of talk in the media about the possibility of a break up of the Euro, we continue to see this as an unlikely occurrence. No political leader wants the Euro to break up as the economic, social and political costs are too great. Firstly there is no legal framework for a country to leave the Eurozone as a country can not be expelled and therefore would have to elect to leave. The main advantage seen to leaving the monetary union would be that the new currency would devalue and competitiveness would increase. However this would be offset by a greater cost to a country. Firstly countries that currently have deficits and are
receiving funding from the EU/IMF would have to have an immediate adjustment as it is highly unlikely that they would be able to fund those deficits on international markets. Other consequences would include a default of government and corporate debt, a collapsed banking system and capital controls that would hamper international trade. The economic fallout would consequently be great.

<strong>Another EU summit…</strong>
Next week is another crucial week for the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis as on Thursday (8th December) the ECB has its meeting, where it may increase support to the banking system and will most likely cut interest rates. It is unlikely that it will announce a quantitative easing program as this would more likely be agreed with the EU leaders at the summit on Friday (December 9th).

As long as politicians can be continually assured that the peripheral governments are implementing the necessary austerity programmes a more complete solution will likely be agreed at this summit. It is yet unclear how this may look but the more recent suggestion of the ECB financing the IMF may be a step forward from the recent deadlock. It is now essential that the ECB is part of whatever solution is agreed and its role needs to increase
regarding a resolution of the crisis. It is clear therefore that there is much more that policy makers can do before they throw in the towel and opt for an expensive break up.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Europe moves closer to integration, albeit slowly</strong>
The EU summit meeting on Friday (9th of December) took the first big step in moving towards a fiscal integration which is a major step in addressing one of the major flaws of the Euro and also removes the moral hazard of supporting a government without having control of any its policies. Nevertheless the resolution has fallen short in many other ways, particularly how Italy and Spain are to raise finance to repay debts in the case of Italy and to fund exchequer spending in the case of Spain in 2012.  Hence we would expect that volatility will continue in Eurozone debt and equity markets well into 2012 and a challenging economic environment to persist. 

<strong>What was agreed on Friday (December 9th)</strong>
<em>Reform agenda continued to push through</em>
EU countries have agreed to set in their constitutions a maximum deficit target which they will adhere to. This rule is to be incorporated into the legal systems at constitutional level. The European Court of Justice will also be involved in transferring the rule at national level. The EU Commission may also be granted more rights to control national budget bills and may have the right to veto the budget bill if it does not comply with the Stability &amp; Growth Pact. Hence some countries may have to hold a referendum to ratify this treaty change.

<em>Strengthening the stabilisation mechanism</em>
Prior to last Friday’s meeting the current bailout mechanism for countries that were finding it difficult to raise funds on the markets was the EFSF fund. This consisted of €440bln, of which Greece, Ireland and Portugal were already drawing funds from. At the October Summit meeting plans were announced to increase this fund to €1tln however investor appetite appeared to be limited for the fund and the €1tln target appeared unlikely. On Friday it was announced that the permanent stability mechanism would be brought forward to July 2012 from July 2013. The governments have committed to “reassessing the adequacy of the overall ceiling of the EFSF/ESM of €500bln”. However increasing the amount available the EFSF/ESM would be politically challenging, particularly as Germany has already faced difficulties in getting agreement on the current level of support that it is providing.

Furthermore the EU will confirm with in ten days of the meeting whether it will commit an additional €200bln funding to the IMF. They expect that these funds will be matched by other international players.  

These two steps have increased the total amount of funds that would be available to member states to approximately €650bln. This is still short of what the market would consider necessary as both Spain and Italy have a requirement of about €600bln in 2012 alone. 

<strong>The ECB’s response to date</strong>
The ECB as expected cut interest rates by 0.25% to 1% on Thursday at this monthly meeting. The central bank has acknowledged the very challenging economic environment that is facing the region and has decided to use unconventional methods aimed at reviving credit growth to foster an economic recovery.  The ECB announced it will provide 3 year liquidity to the banking sector and also loosened the collateral rules allowing the banking sector gain this additional liquidity.  However contrary to expectations that the ECB would be in some way part of the resolution at the Summit meeting on Friday, President Draghi closed the door, if anything to the possibility of extending the current SMP programme which allows the central bank to purchase government bonds in the secondary market. He also pushed out any speculation that the ECB may lend money to the IMF.

<strong>Where are we now?</strong>
The most positive and important step from the summit was that all the members of the EMU (European Monetary Union) remain committed to the currency union and have taken a step towards close fiscal integration. However the path that they have chosen is disappointing, particularly compared to what we had been expecting last week.  

<ul>
<li>Eurozone government bonds, particularly for countries with higher debt and deficit dynamics, remains a much riskier asset class than investors of government bonds typically like to take, as private sector losses remain a possibility for such assets. It is difficult to see the traditional investor base returning to purchase government bonds when such a risk continues to persist. </li>
<li>As a result the ECB has been the only purchaser in town. However President Draghi’s speech on Thursday implied that the ECB is withdrawing support rather than previous expectations that the ECB would be a key part of a solution in the short term.</li>
<li>The large refinancing needs for Spain &amp; Italy remain for 2012, particularly the first quarter of 2012. The mechanism for support of country that can only finance its debt on the bond markets at an unsustainable price remains too small to support these countries over the next year.</li><li>The treaty changes will be drafted up before March 2012 and after that individual countries will be faced with ratifying the changes. This will pose political risks, most notably for France, whose general election is due to take place in May 2012. </li>
</ul>

The market reaction to the summit has been subdued, although the Euro has been seen the largest losses falling to 1.32 from 1.33 against the dollar on Friday. Peripheral government bonds yields have also increased, albeit remain well below the highs that were seen in November, while the ten year German government bond yield decreased to 2.04% from 2.1% on Wednesday evening prior to the ECB announcement. Equity markets in Europe have traded lower. We would expect that volatility will continue in this environment for both equity markets and bond markets as uncertainty around the Euro debt crisis have yet to be resolved. In this environment core government bonds should continue to outperform.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[2011 saw two distinct halves for investors and once being on the right side of the risk on or risk off trade at the appropriate time rewarded investors. Investors with appetite for riskier assets benefited during the first half of the year, but a more cautious approach rewarded investors in the second half. Furthermore the optimism around inflation, economic growth and higher risk asset prices all faded in the second half of the year. Concerns about the indebtedness of the advanced economies dominated and resulted in a flight to quality that saw gold reach record high levels, government bond yields of the safe havens such as Germany, UK and US reach a new low level and equity markets in emerging markets, Europe and Japan fall. Fears of rising inflation and tighter monetary policy stances from the first half of the year were replaced with suspicions of a double dip recession and even looser monetary policy. One other striking outcome of 2011 has been the divergence in performance of US and European equities, which has resulted in a significant valuation differential.

<h3>Eurozone Crisis – the continued search for the golden solution</h3>

The sovereign crisis in Europe spread into the larger economies, especially after EU leaders conceded to their commitment that private sector holders of Eurozone government bonds would not have to take a haircut, after they asked the private sector holders of Greek debt to take first a 20% haircut and then later in the year a 50% haircut. This attached a credit risk to Eurozone government debt and set the yields on Italian and Spanish government bonds to a level where Ireland, Portugal and Greece received a bailout from the IMF/EU. However as the current bailout system is inadequate to deal with the large financing needs of these countries, markets feared the worst and began pricing in a recession and even the possibility that the Euro may no longer exist in its current form. The ECB stepped up its efforts to help these government bond markets and restarted its SMP bond purchasing programme and managed to keep the 10 year yields of Italy and Spain below 7% and 6% respectively, albeit an unsustainable level for these countries to refinance themselves. In December the ECB announced that it would lend an unlimited amount of money to the banking system at 1% for 3 years in December and again in February 2012, allowing the banking sector to refinance its maturing debt over the next few months which has also resulted in yields of government bonds with a maturity of up to three years to fall. This along with the commitment by EU leaders for closer fiscal integration has reinforced views that policy makers will do whatever necessary to keep monetary union together. The solution to date has not been the “golden solution” that markets have been looking for and therefore has resulted in much higher market volatility. However policy makers are ensuring that individual countries with higher debt and deficit problem adopt the necessary austerity and reform programmes and are just about doing enough to avoid liquidity or funding crises.

<h3>The debt crisis has dominated bond markets</h3>

In 2011 bond market volatility has increased, particularly as the Eurozone sovereign crisis has led to a wide dispersion in the performance of government bond markets. The higher growth outlook and inflationary concerns in the first quarter of 2011, led to a spike in government bond yields, back to what would have been seen as a more normalized range. For example in April the ten year German government bond yield peaked at close to 3.5%. However soon after that risk aversion increased and AAA government bond yields fell as investors sought out much safer assets and the ten year German government bond reached a historical low level of 1.67% in September. Furthermore the divergence between bond markets in Europe also widened during this period as the spread between the Italian and Spanish government bond yield over the Germany government bond yield moved out to historically high levels. Even other AAA government bonds such as France saw increased yields as markets started put an additional credit risk on French bonds. Despite this, the Italian government bond market was the principal underperformer in 2011. Some of these losses in government bond markets were recouped in December, especially after the ECB announced the three year LTRO, or longer term liquidity into the banking system which has led to increased buying of government bonds towards the end of the year.

<h3>Equity markets have re-rated significantly in 2011</h3>

Global equity markets sold off significantly in the second half of 2011, notably in August when risk aversion peaked. Concerns about a global recession as well as the contagion effects of the Eurozone sovereign crisis has resulted in 10-15% sell off in European, Japanese and Emerging market equities. These market moves have come despite the resilience in earnings expectations for the full year 2011 as earnings grew by 3.6%, 2.5% and 7% respectively. As a result valuation levels have fallen back towards the levels that were seen at the bottom of the market in 2009 for these regions. US equities have also de-rated although to a smaller extent as earnings are expected to increase by 10% and markets increased by just 3%. Currently European and emerging markets equities are trading on 9 times 2011 and 2012 earnings, while US equities are on 13 times. Going into 2012, expectations are that earnings forecasts will be revised down further, although at these valuation levels, a lot is in the price.

<h3>Currency markets pushed safe haven currencies higher</h3>

In 2011 two central banks, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank intervened in currency markets to curb the increases of the yen and the Swiss Franc, which had been increasing as currency investors sought out “safer asset” classes. The Swiss National Bank has successfully managed to put a floor on its currency, which had been rising steadily since 2007 and was starting to negatively impact the Swiss economy due to an erosion of competitiveness. Similarly the Japanese yen rose to a record level and the Bank of Japan intervened in markets. Elsewhere in currency markets the Euro held up well for most of the year, especially considering the moves that were evident in government bond and equity markets in Europe. However sentiment towards the currency turned more negative in the latter months of the year as it suffered losses against sterling and the Dollar.

<h3>Ireland became the poster child in Europe</h3>

Although the yield on Irish government bonds increased in the first half of 2011, investor sentiment towards Ireland became much more positive in the second half of the year. Firstly the government managed to renegotiate the interest that the EU and IMF are charging on the money that Ireland borrows from them. This greatly improved the debt sustainability for Ireland. Furthermore news that Bank of Ireland had received an investment from a group of US investors also helped to improve the positivity towards Ireland as did news that the economy grew in the first half of the year on the back of stronger exports. As a result Ireland government bonds have outperformed and the yields on the ten year government bond fell from a high of 14% to finish the year 8.2%.

<h3>Looking towards 2012</h3>
Going into 2012, the Eurozone sovereign crisis remains high on the agenda. A key risk for the first quarter of 2012 is how or at what cost Spain, Italy and France will refinance the large amount of debt that is set to mature during the quarter. This issue alone will create volatility for equity and bond markets. However if we muddle through the crisis yields on government bonds in Europe should converge with German yields rising as some risk aversion eases and other Eurozone bond yields falling as the credit risk being attached to these bonds eases.

Aside from this earnings are expected to be downgraded on the back of the slower economic growth outlook. However equity markets in Europe, emerging markets and Japan have de-rated significantly during 2011 as prices fell by 12-15% even though earnings have increased by 5-10% in these regions. As a result equity market valuation levels are now close to the March 2009 level implying that equities are now pricing in a lot of bad news. In the US the de-rating has not been as aggressive as in Europe although valuations are still well below long term averages levels. Therefore if investors have the risk tolerances to cope with the volatility that may arise as a result of the Eurozone sovereign crisis, equity market are looking more attractive now than they have done in recent history.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[This morning we released our claims statistics for 2011, this is something we do around this time every year and it gives us an opportunity to emphasize how important Life Insurance can be in securing your family's future in the event or the unthinkable. It also allows our customers to see what were the main causes of claims in the preceding year. And cancer was once again the main cause of claims for both death and specified illness benefit in 2011.

Overall, in 2011 we paid more than €81 million in death benefit to 1,311 dependents – an average payment of just over €62,000, and paid out almost €36 million in specified illness cover (SIC) in respect of more than 600 claims, an average payment of more than €59,000.

Once again these figures show how important it is for Irish people to take steps to look after their dependents in the case of serious illness or worse still death. Death and specified illness cover are one of the best value insurance products available and it's important to emphasise that this sort of financial protection is just as important for those on lower incomes as it is for those on higher incomes.

To give an example from last year, we settled a €100,000 claim with a 39-year-old shop assistant just eight weeks after she took out her serious illness cover. It’s probably fair to say that the €100,000 we paid out to that customer is more significant for her than some substantially bigger claims we settled for customers on higher incomes.

A 35 year-old can obtain €100,000 worth of death and specified illness cover for the next 15 years for just €10 a week and at Irish Life, we will pay out whichever claims comes first – specified illness or death. €10 a week for the peace of mind €100,000 worth of cover provides is extraordinarily good value.

It is also significant that almost 4 in every 10 accident-related death claims involved people under the age of 40, highlighting the need for people to take out life assurance at an early age. Accidents accounted for 11% of the death claims we settled last year and a large proportion of these accident-related claims involved young people.

Of the more than 1,300 death claims Irish Life settled last year, 44% were the result of cancer and 18% the result of heart-related conditions. But 11% of death claims – a total of 141 - were the result of accidents and of these alcohol was a factor in one in seven. It has to be of real concern that alcohol continues to feature as a factor so prominently in our accident-related claims. Year after year, the same pattern is there and the various public awareness campaigns don't seem to be having much effect. Maybe we need to consider a different approach.

Cancer remains the main cause of specified illness claims, accounting for almost-two thirds of the 603 claims settled, and of those claims, breast cancer accounted for some 28%, followed by prostate cancer (8.5%) and colon cancer (4.8%).

Monday morning I spoke to Ian Guider on NewsTalk about the figures, you can listen back here:

<content:encoded><![CDATA[It sounded romantic and I’m sure in plenty of houses around Ireland it was sold as such; a weekend in Paris to celebrate Valentines, Irish ladies would be treated in their thousands this year to romance in the city of love.  The stage was set for a hot weekend.  However, as the temperature hit -9 degrees in Paris last Saturday night, the romance was on hold, it was going to be about the passion for the next 80 minutes; passion to be shown not by 1 man alone, but indeed by 15 men in Green!!

Unfortunately, Mother Nature (and some bad planning to say the least) intervened and as loyal fans cursed a lack of under-soil heating, they retreated to the heart of Paris for an early night. Many will ask if anything positive will come of the weekend or was it a weekend wasted? We heard interviewees use words such as “disgrace” and “disappointment” but they had surely forgot the love!?!  You see, all was not lost; perhaps the romance and the early night will help us maintain our grand slam lead in one area where we have regular 6 nations success – our replacement fertility levels!!

Yes indeed, except for a blip in performance levels in 2005 and 2006 we have consistently lead our 6 nations rivals in the reproduction stakes!  Romance is alive and well in Ireland!!

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/chart1.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1213" title="Grand Slam" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/chart1.png" alt="" width="600" height="308" /></a>

It acts as an important reminder as we arrive into the last 2 weeks of our special two month cash-back offer on new Life Insurance plans.  When the fertility rate rises, it means more new families and larger families, which of course increases the need for parents to take out Life Insurance to ensure their families are provided for financially should the unfortunate happen.

It may not be romantic but it’s as practical as under-soil heating in Paris in the Spring!

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Acceptance speeches may not be our forte, but we are extremely proud to have been chosen by Brokers for the Top Life Company award, again.
<blockquote>"They really provide a quality service to brokers in all areas and are eager to improve and help by thinking outside the box where necessary.  They are flexible and helpful."</blockquote>
For the second year running, the members of the Irish Brokers Association(IBA) voted the service Irish Life provides to them and their clients as the best in the business.  We also hold the same award from the Professional Insurance Brokers Association(PIBA).

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IBA6.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1239 aligncenter" title="IBA" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IBA6.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="300" /></a>
<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter">
<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter"><dl id="attachment_1239" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 460px;"><dd class="wp-caption-dd">Tony Lawless, General Manager of Brokerage in Irish Life, receiving the award from IBA President Mr Carl Rainey. Also pictured from left to right: Barry Skelton, Susan Gibson, Paul Smith, John Roberts, Gerry Hassett, Donal Wood, Dave Lennon and Andy O'Connor </dd></dl></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of the 44 categories for the IBA awards, Irish Life ranked best in 35, and were the only company from the top 3 to improve its score year on year.  The PIBA have 32 categories that are judged, and Irish Life came top in 28 of those, and 2nd in the remaining four.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Most superior company in the market in terms of new business, products offered, underwriting and administration.  Not matched on the market."</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">So what does it all mean?  Well, by holding both awards, Irish Life is now unanimously the No 1 choice for Brokers in Ireland.  In terms of support offered to brokers, range and quality of products, and quality of staff, Irish Life has been voted 2nd to none.</p>

<blockquote>"Excellent all around.  Very much in partnerships with brokers."</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">To sum it all up, we are extremely proud to win these awards but rather than resting on our laurels, we are more determined than ever to further improve our scores in all categories, and continue to be the no 1 supporter of independant Brokers in Ireland.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you'll pardon our bashful ways, um - thanks...again.  But there's more work to do.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <span style="color: #000000;">The saying “your health is your wealth” rang true when we conducted an attitude survey among 1,000 adults recently.<span style="font-family: Arial;">   The main concern for 37% of those surveyed was that they or their partner would become ill or die suddenly, compared to 16% who were more concerned with losing their job.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  Losing their home (11%) and being unable to pay bills (10%) were the next most important concerns for the respondents.</span></span>
<blockquote><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The main concern for 37% of those surveyed was that they or their partner would become ill or die suddenly</span></span></span></blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000;">Half of those surveyed said they are aware of a family where the main income earner died prematurely at less than 50 years of age.</span> 

[caption id="attachment_1262" align="aligncenter" width="542" caption="Irish Life launches campaign to raise awareness that cover starts from €15"]<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/D10917-0016.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1262" title="Irish life launch.Picture Fennells" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/D10917-0016-1024x716.jpg" alt="" width="542" height="424" /></a>[/caption]

<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter"> </div>
<span style="color: #000000;">The survey reveals that in general people totally overestimate the cost of taking out a family protection plan.<span style="font-family: Arial;">  In fact, almost 70% of those surveyed thought life insurance costs over €35 a month, which is more than twice the normal starting cost of €15 a month for €100,000 cover for a typical 35 year old parent.</span></span>
<blockquote><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It would take the average household 80 years or more to save €100,000 for their family by putting €15 by on deposit to help their family financially in the event of death.</span></span></span></blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000;">Gerry Hassett, Head of Irish Life Retail said, “The survey shows that although the main concern people have is around what might happen if they or their partner became ill or died, people need to take steps to protect their lives or the lives of their families.<span style="font-family: Arial;">  While it makes sense to put some money by for a rainy day, it costs just €15 a month to get €100,000 worth of life cover for a typical 35 year old parent of young children.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  It would take the average household 80 years or more to save €100,000 for their family by putting €15 by on deposit to help their family financially in the event of death.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  Rather than just topping up their savings, people really should consider protecting their family with life insurance.”</span></span>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Note: </strong>€100,000 worth of life insurance costs €15 per month for a 35 year old male or female non smoker with Irish Life’s Life Term Cover plan.<span style="font-family: Arial;">  The cost of life insurance depends on your age, health, amount of cover, gender and product type.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">  80 years to save €100,000 based on monthly savings of €15 on deposit at 4% per year net interest rate, after tax.</span></span></p>
<span style="color: #000000;">The research was carried out in March 2012 by iReach, with a sample size of 1,000 adults of 18+ using a nationally representative model.</span>

<title>Taxi’s, Savings plans and Life Insurance!</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[It was a wild evening last Wednesday and it cost me €18 in taxi fares, but it was just one of those evenings where you just really wanted to get into the warmth and out of the rain, it felt like €18 well spent when the door shut behind me.  It was easy to imagine the origin of the saying “saving for a rainy day”.  It was not a night for going back out!<br/><br/>The rainy day is on a lot of minds at the moment, as we are all too aware, anyone who is lucky enough to have money, is saving like we’re in a never ending storm. Let’s hope we’re not but that’s a discussion for another day! Right now we all want the peace of mind that both ourselves; and our families can keep the proverbial fire alight should our rainy day come. It makes sense.<br/><br/>But it got me to thinking, had I walked home, or more realistically got the bus, I’d have saved about €15.  Say I saved this amount every month for 10 years, how would that help the nest egg? Well, in 10 years time, saving €15 a month, that would leave me with €1,800 plus whatever interest I can get, so I felt I need lots of €15’s to really make a difference but it did make me feel better about getting the taxi!! <br/><br/>There are many other uses for my €15 and I’m sure yours, but of course working in the industry, it did highlight the value in Life Insurance right now. For some like me, a 32 year old man, I could set up a life cover plan for the next 10 years with my €15 a month and this would ensure that my family would receive €196,317 should the worst come to the worst and I die in that time. It’s not a pleasant thought granted, but it’s a big figure and maybe worth being part of your rainy day planning? <br/><br/>So if you’ve got something specific you’re saving for then great, I say go for it, but if like me, you’re storing up a small bit extra for peace of mind, then €196,317 is a lot of peace of mind for €15.  It might be worth thinking about this weekend. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.irishlife.ie/life-assurance/15-euro-life-insurance-quote-monthly.html?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=affordability" title="life insurance quote">Check out how much Life Insurance you can get for €15 a month.</a>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We’ve spent a little time cleaning up our blog, as regular readers may notice. We’ll be ironing out any bugs over the next week or two. We're always working to keep things fresh so we hope you like the clean up! 

Speaking of freshness and in the interest of it being a Friday (and for some blatant padding out of this post) why not sit back and enjoy some of the best of what the internet has to offer us on this very day:

<strong>200 reasons not to leave Dublin</strong>
‘Phoenix Park ‘, ‘A proper fry’, ‘Dublin Bikes’, ‘The girls are so pretty’ – just some of the top 200 reasons not to leave Dublin from an article on <a title="totallydublin.ie" href="http://www.totallydublin.ie" target="_blank">http://www.totallydublin.ie</a> which is trending on <a title="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/">twitter</a> <a title="trending rightnow" href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%22200%20Reasons%20Not%20To%20Leave%20Dublin%22">right now</a>.

<strong>You just got Geoff Shreevesed</strong>
Geoff Shreeves ripping Ivanovic’s heart out on live television is a top video on youtube today:

<strong>Ridiculously Photogenic Guy</strong>
<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ridiculously-photogenic-guy-zeddie-little" target="_blank"> Ridiculously Photogenic Guy,</a> currently one of the internet meme's doing the rounds (can you spot him?):

<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ridiculously-photogenic-guy-zeddie-little"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1436" title="photogenicguy" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/photogenicguy.jpg" alt="" width="408" height="271" /></a>

<strong>OMGPOP - It's what all the kids say these days</strong>
<img class="wp-image-1440 alignleft" title="omgpop" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/omgpop-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="65" height="65" />And finally, my favourite; the ‘<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.omgpop.dstpaid&amp;feature=top-paid#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDIwNiwiY29tLm9tZ3BvcC5kc3RwYWlkIl0." target="_blank">Draw Something</a>’ app for smart phones which is available for download at all good app stores. If you haven't played it yet then you're missing out, it's top notch.</a><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>]]></content:encoded>

<title>‘Mobile’ is the buzzword of the Year</title>
<link>http://blog.irishlife.ie/internet/mobile-is-the-buzzword-of-the-year/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I find it’s an important task, at the start of every year, to research and learn what the top 10 buzzwords I’m likely to hear during that year will be. It’s important because when the bossman comes a knockin’ we need to be ahead of the game so we can lower his expectations straight away.

‘<em>Mobile</em>’ has now replaced ‘<em>Viral</em>’ which replaced ‘<em>Social</em>’ as the most common buzzword said at me over the past 2 years. Now I am generally sceptical about buzzwords - my blank stare response is usually a good indication of this - mainly because it’s hard to use 1 or 2 or even 3 words to describe what can be an entire world of…anything.

So at the start of the year I see ‘mobile this’ and ‘mobile that’ as being the popular buzzwords I’m about to hear, in truth they have been popular for a number of years but 2012 is really the year of mobile. When I see them being popular I know that it’s what I’ll be hearing from the bossman over the next few months.

Strangely for a buzzword this makes me pretty happy. It means we’re really thinking about what a customer wants rather than jumping onto a bandwagon. Customers don’t necessarily want a viral video or the ability to ‘like’ us, but if it’s there they’ll embrace it. They <strong>do want</strong> the ability to connect with their policies in an easier way. Mobile just makes things easy.

<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/app.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1488" title="The Irish Life app" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/app-300x165.png" alt="The Irish Life app" width="300" height="165" /></a>

So we began the year thinking mobile and this week we’re realising mobile with the release of our new app for customers on the Apple iTunes and Google Play markets:

<a title="Download the Irish Life App for Customers" href="http://www.irishlife.ie/mobile/my-irish-life-app.html" target="_blank">http://www.irishlife.ie/mobile/my-irish-life-app.html</a>

You can now log in to our app and view your policy plan information. Depending on your type of product, you can see: Current values, Payment History, Investment history and Fund performances.

<strong>Who will use an Irish Life app?</strong>

It’s crazy to think but 10% of all traffic to irishlife.ie is from mobile phones. Every month that is growing. 1 in 10 people are reading this on a smartphone. The new Galaxy SIII phone from Samsung is out in 2 weeks and has a whopping 9 million pre-orders already and growing. 5 million a month will be sold. The mobile world is getting bigger and the phones are getting smarter.

According to google* smartphone penetration in Ireland is at 43% and 61% of these people access the internet every day using their phone. 89% of smartphone users surf the web while doing something else like watching TV. Over a quarter (26%) of these people would rather give up that TV than give up their smartphone.

It’s important to Irish Life that we don’t restrict users from checking their policies just because they’re not near a pc. Smartphones are computers now. That is why we’ve released this app and that’s why in 2012 we’re going mobile.

<title>So what does this eBusiness team do then?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[If I had a euro for every time I have been asked “What does the eBusiness team do?” I might be on my way to Poznan now instead of sitting here writing this.  The general consensus seems to be that we chill out all day, updating our facebook pages, watching youtube on our iPads, and comparing the latests apps on our smartphones, but I can assure you, only some of that is correct!!

In February 2010, Shay Browne was appointed e Czar, and his first task was to assemble a team of young and hip people with their fingers on the pulse of internet and social media developments.  After finding that none of his top 100 candidates wanted to join the team, he settled for <a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/author/stephen">Stephen Hayden</a> and myself as his first recruits.

Our first tasks were simple, modernise <a href="http://www.irishlife.ie/">www.irishlife.ie</a>, develop a pension calculator, develop a social media strategy for the company, build some iphone apps, get on Facebook, Twitter and basically be on top of what ever buzzword was cool at the time.  We quickly figured out that this was more than a two man job, and <a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/author/colin">Colin O’Hara</a> was drafted in, <a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/author/ger">Ger Coughlan</a> became the big boss man and later <a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/author/george">George Fox</a> answered the call.
<p style="text-align: left;">Since then we have been constantly developing and improving the website, making it more user friendly and advice based.  We have built a range of online calculators, smartphone apps, started our own blog site, developed an online advertising strategy and are active on Facebook, Twitter and Google+.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">This app allows you to keep up to date with all your Irish Life Plans information while on the move.  Depending on your product type, you can check current values, payment history, investment history and fund performances.</p>
</blockquote>
Mobile is the latest buzzword doing the rounds, and keeping with that, we have developed our Online Services Smartphone App.  This app allows you to keep up to date with all your Irish Life Plans information while on the move.  Depending on your product type, you can check current values, payment history, investment history and fund performances.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

You can sign up to paperless statements, receive all your documents online, and view all previous correspondance.  We can send you SMS and e-mail alerts when new documents have been added.  You can also view investment fund factsheets and have access to our Blog and video commentaries.

You can download the app for your smartphone from <a href="http://www.irishlife.ie/mobile/my-irish-life-app.html">here</a>.

So that's it, we are currently scouring the internet searching for the next big buzzword so that we can be ahead of the game, oh and also checking out the latest cute kitten videos on Youtube and creating new Angry Birds top scores!!!

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><strong><span>"When I look at the smiles on all the children's faces I just know they're about to jab me with something."   --Homer Simpson </span></strong></blockquote>
I can't wait for Father's day. Been looking forward to it for ages. It's the one day of the year when we - the daddies - the men of the house - can be the centre of attention for a few short hours. We get a card and the wife and kids do their best to be nice to us for just one day. Who knows, we might also get control of the TV remote if we're lucky.

On Father's day last year I was having a grand old time making the most of the day when my 6 year old daughter decided she'd had enough. "I'm tired of this" she says, "You never do anything for us".

"Wha, I never do anything, do I. Is that what you think?" I say increduously.

"Yeah", she says, "starting to giggle".

Ha Ha - big mistake! "Right then," I began.

"Who reads your bedtime stories?"

"Who brings you out cycling and makes sure you've got your helmet on properly?"

"Who brings you to the playground in the park and stands underneath you, ready to catch you, when you climb the monkey bars?"

"Who makes sure you have enough sun-blocker on so you don't get sunburned?"

"Who makes sure we always have a band-aid and a hug when you cut your knee?"

"Who pays for the food you eat and the house you live in rent free?" - Well, ok, I didn't say the last one.

At this point she lost interest and ran back outside to play with her brother.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1537" title="two-monsters" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/two-monsters1.jpg" alt="Two monsers" width="250" height="188" />

I sat there thinking - it's a day to realise how much you do look out for them. You get more out of it than any amount of thanks could give - and then still milk the thanks anyway!!

Enjoy the day lads!]]></content:encoded>

<title>GAA Football Championship 2012 - The view from the man in the middle</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Championship 2012 is getting to the business end of the season. The new GAA president Liam O' Neill appoints new committees for his 3 year term of office. He has appointed Pat McEnaney as the head of the referees committee.  Pat brings huge experience to the job having been one of the top inter-country football referees for many years. There’s no doubt he’s going to be good for refereeing and he’ll look to develop new refereeing talent during his tenure. The committee have already started down this road with championship panel places being given to Barry Cassidy (Derry) &amp; Conor Lane (Cork) this year. This continues the policy of developing referees that was progressed under the last committee.

I’ve been north and south over the last few weeks refereeing Cork-Kerry and Tyrone-Donegal in championship 2012. The games have passed off without major incident. Referees are individuals and each has their own personal communication style on the pitch. I’m a firm believer in maintaining control through regular communication with players. It tends to serve me well but it’s a personal approach. Having said that, the rules are applied and when big decisions have to be made, they’re made.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1569" title="donegal_game" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/donegal_game-1024x291.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="204" /></p>
A referee needs to be able to read a game. Being able to read a game allows a referee to know when he can let play develop and when he needs to step in. This isn’t always easy and comes with experience. I’m not saying a referee will get that balance right all the time, even with experience. A referee has to be physically and mentally prepared for a game so that he can sense quickly if his control over the game is waning and he can retrieve the situation quickly &amp; easily.

We’re already in early July but unfortunately the summer hasn’t really arrived yet. Wet &amp; windy conditions are hard for players to deal with and it’s the same for referees. A referee needs to try to allow for conditions but ultimately players need to take responsibility for their own behaviour no matter what the conditions.
<blockquote> Being able to read a game allows a referee to know when he can let play develop and when he needs to step in.</blockquote>
Media attention on referees hasn’t reduced since last year, if anything social media has brought it to another level. It is unfortunate that referees are becoming the subject of social media ‘tweets’ but it’s the age that we live in and there’s not a lot we can do about it (the rugby approach appears to be to reply but I’m not sure that helps!). All I would say (and I have said this before) is that a referee goes out to do his best in every game and never to “do” a player or team. Mistakes can be made, just like players &amp; managers. A common denominator for managers, players and referees is that we all hope that any mistake won’t affect the outcome of a game. Respect is a two way street. Referees need to respect players &amp; team officials and vice-versa. The GAA’s ‘Give Respect, Get Respect’ initiative which is an attempt to build this two-way respect from schools level up is a good idea but it’ll only work if all parties are bought into it.
<blockquote> The GAA’s ‘Give Respect, Get Respect’ initiative which is an attempt to build this two-way respect from schools level up is a good idea but it’ll only work if all parties are bought into it.</blockquote>
Championship referees meet once every 3 weeks during the championship season. These sessions focus on key decisions made by referees since the last time we met. The sessions are open &amp; honest. There are no hiding places – numerous video clips are reviewed &amp; debated. Each referee has an opportunity to voice his opinion, starting with the referee involved. It’s not a scapegoat exercise but it is an extremely important learning tool. Referees, not unlike players &amp; managers, can always improve their performance and this is what we’re striving to do.

The next set of appointments has just been made and I’ve been appointed to referee the round 2 qualifier game between Laois &amp; Monaghan. Preparations have started &amp; hopefully it’ll go well.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[According to Google research* only 19% of Irish people are <em>‘Completely Satisfied’</em> with browsing websites on a smartphone. That’s pretty low considering that about 55% of Irish people look for information about local businesses or services on a smartphone at least once a week.

People look for this information no matter where they are:

<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/stats.mobile.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1591 alignnone" title="Where people use a mobile device in ireland to search online" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/stats.mobile.jpg" alt="Where people use a mobile device in ireland to search online" width="296" height="327" /></a>

&#160;

Setting up a useful mobile version of <a title="IrishLife.ie" href="http://irishlife.ie" target="_blank">irishlife.ie</a> is a goal we’ve had for a while but now the statistics were lining up in our favour to make it a reality. In June 2012, 15.75% of all traffic to <a title="irishlife.ie" href="http://irishlife.ie" target="_blank">irishlife.ie</a> was from mobile devices. For the same period in 2011 it was only 5.46%. More Android devices are switched on every day than people are born (700k Vs 300k). So usage is going one direction but satisfaction is not following as fast. Websites aren’t responding quickly enough. It was important that we respected how people prefer to visit our website and responding to that is a way to show that respect. So we did.

Over the last week or two we’ve rolled out our mobile website – <a title="Mobile Irish Life" href="http://m.irishlife.ie" target="_blank">m.irishlife.ie</a> - with a single goal of serving the needs of mobile specific customers &amp; users. We redirect our mobile visitors to this site automatically. Our mobile website offers a vastly superior user experience than viewing a desktop website on a small screen.

It is, however, just the beginning for our mobile website. We’ll be building up statistics on how users interact with the various pages on the mobile site, we’ll listen to feedback and we’ll test as much as we can so updates and changes continually improve the site. It’s been a positive experience so far and we hope that it will continue.

<strong>Here are some initial indicators of a better user experience on the mobile site than on the desktop site when using a smartphone.</strong>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Irish Life today published their Interim Results for the first half of 2012, posting a profit (IFRS) of €96m – up six fold for the same period a year ago.  On an Embedded Value basis the Group recorded profits of €112m (2011: €5m loss) and the embedded value of the Group at the mid-year was €1.8 billion.

&#160;

The company also reported an increase in life and investment sales of 6% compared to the same period a year ago and a rise of almost €2 billion in Funds Under Management at Irish Life Investment Managers.  The firm grew its market share in all key market segments and has a market share of 29% in the life and pensions market and over 1 million customers.  Its market share in fund management is 33%.  The company is the largest private payer of pensions in the country.

At a strategic level, the period was dominated by the separation of the businesses of Irish Life from those of permanent tsb and the acquisition of Irish Life’s businesses in June by the Minister for finance.

&#160;

Group Chief Executive Kevin Murphy acknowledged the support of the Minister and said the Group’s strategic priority was to ensure that the Minister’s investment could be fully recouped when the Group was ultimately returned to the private sector; “We’re very conscious of the support of the Minister and the taxpayer and we are determined to ensure that this can be repaid fully as soon as practicable.  We’re optimistic that this will be the case.”

Mr Murphy added that the economic environment remained very challenging and that retail sales of investment products in particular were hit by the lower levels of disposable income in the economy; “This is a very tough market and will remain so for a number of years.  But ultimately the economy will stabilise and recover and its clear that we are very well positioned to benefit from that when it occurs.  In the meantime our focus is firmly on managing costs, continuing to innovate in terms of product development and managing and improving our service levels for customers.”

<title>Attitudes to Retirement Survey</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[&#160;

We published our findings from a major survey on attitudes to retirement this week.  When asked for their key aspirations in retirement, 89% of the 1,000 adults polled said “good health” while 81% said “financial security for myself and my spouse”.

The survey also found that 43% do not know how they will manage financially in retirement.  Nearly half (45%) of people say they have no private or company pension provisions.  Of these, 1 in 4 say that they will rely solely on the state pension to fund their retirement lifestyle.
<blockquote>The survey also found that 43% do not know how they will manage financially in retirement.</blockquote>
Commenting on the findings of the survey, Gerry Hassett, Chief Executive, Irish Life Retail said, “As well as providing practical financial support to people in their retirement, a pension also helps people to fulfil their hopes and dreams in later life.  The reality is that the state pension will not be enough for people to live on yet our research shows that only half of people have their own pension plan.”
<blockquote>While these are obviously difficult times, it’s important that people realise that a pension is also an investment in our family’s future and that it deserves real planning and consideration like other aspects of our lives.”</blockquote>
The survey coincides with our of a new advertising campaign aimed at raising awareness of the importance of planning for your retirement. Our tv ad features “Sean and Babs”, and Sean has a few “innovative” plans for how they can fund their retirement fund.  To ensure you don’t end up like Sean, check out <a href="http://www.irishlife.ie">www.irishlife.ie</a> where you will find a range of tools to help you plan for your retirement on our website, including our pension calculator and our new simple guide to pensions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The dust may have settled in the rest of the country, but “Jimmy’s Winning Matches” can still be heard ringing out from the North West of the Country.  20 years is not a long time in the grand scheme of things, but when it’s the gap between your first and second ever All Ireland Football victories, ask any Donegal fan and they will tell you it’s an eternity.

But the wait is over, and Donegal are the champions, overcoming a valiant Mayo side in the decider with a scoreline of 2-11 to 0-13.  The hunt for tickets in the build-up to the encounter was phenomenal, with one pair of premium level tickets being sold on eBay for €7,100!

One Donegal woman who got to treat her son with tickets to the game was Mrs Ann Mcgroary from Laghey.  Ann entered a competition organised by Irish Life Customer Services and won two premium level tickets for the big game.

[caption id="attachment_1698" align="aligncenter" width="224"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-1698" title="Mrs Ann McGroary" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/WP_000027-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /> Our lucky winner Mrs Ann McGroary pictured with her two Premium Level tickets[/caption]

Ann's son had attended all Donegal's matches in the lead up to the final but couldn't secure tickets for the big day.  He had been doing a few odd jobs around the house for his mammy, and wouldn't take any payment, so when Ann offered him the two tickets for the final, he couldn't believe it until he actually saw them for himself!

So, the day was enjoyed by all in Donegal, and according to Ann, the party is still going strong in the North West, with a backlog of loan applications to fund the celebrations.  Congrats to Ann(and her son) again and lets hope it won't be another 20 years before we see them back!

<title>Understanding the Gender Directive</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[For most people, it’s the slightly surprising mild inconvenience you’ve never even heard about. But make no mistake, its coming. By the end of December this year the EU gender directive will be in place and insurance as you know it might be changed forever. What the gender directive means is that insurance companies will not be able to discriminate between men and women in assessing risk for insurance purposes.

<strong>So what will that mean?</strong>
Well, if you’re a woman, you currently pay on average 25% less for Life Insurance with Irish Life than men. This is because women tend to live longer than men, and are generally rewarded for this in their insurance premiums. And if you’re a man? Sullen stares and grumbles from the ladies in your life about having to take up the financial slack for our general inability to keep ourselves out of harm’s way. 

<strong>Brass Tacks</strong>
From December 21st, prices will be the same for men and women. Unfortunately this means that the cost of life insurance for women is likely to increase.
To give an example; currently, a smoking man, aged 39 who has a €150,000 Life Insurance plan with Irish Life for 25 years, pays €49.37 per month. This is €11.19 (25%) more than a smoking woman of the same age. 

<strong>What if I don’t have life insurance?</strong>
Act now before the change. Any policy taken out and fully issued on or before the 21st December 2012 will remain at those rates even after the 21st December.

<strong>What if I have a policy already in place?</strong>
No change. The directive only applies to new contracts concluded after 21st December 2012.

<strong>What if I am currently in the process of taking out a policy?</strong>
Current rates will only be applicable until the 21st December. Therefore, any policies not in force before the 21st December 2012 will not be issued using current rates, and therefore may potentially incur higher premiums.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<dl id="attachment_1826"><dt><img class="alignleft" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/wiht-love2-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="139" /></dt></dl>It’s oh ho ho so easy to get caught up in the Christmas craziness… Tinsel, glitter, mince pies, shopping, presents, nights out. But Christmas is also about a lot more… <em>(Don’t worry I’m not going to take a religious stance on this!)</em> It's also about time

spent with friends, loved ones and remembering what matters most - family.  Christmas is a time to cherish and acknowledge all of those day-to-day kindnesses we sometimes neglect to appreciate and a time when we really miss those we love if they cannot be with us...
<blockquote>It may seem like an unlikely present - it’s not something we like to think about</blockquote>
It may seem like an unlikely present, and it’s not something we often like to think about, but providing life insurance for your family in the event that something awful happens to you, could be the greatest gift of all. At the moment women typically pay 25% less than men for life insurance, so there is room for bargain hunting – even when it comes to life insurance.

&#160;
<blockquote>From 21 December 2012 the Gender Directive states - women and men will pay the same prices for new life insurance plans.</blockquote>
However from 21 December 2012 onward, women and men will pay the same price for new life insurance plans. This upcoming change is a result of the Gender Directive (a European Court ruling) which states that having different prices for insurance plans based on gender is discriminatory and should not be allowed.  In future the cost of your life insurance will depend on your age, health and the level and type of cover alone, and not on your gender. The traditional difference women have enjoyed on life insurance plans compared to their male counterparts will disappear.
<blockquote>In the run up to Christmas women's life insurance is 25% cheaper than their male counterparts.</blockquote>
Over the next few weeks in the run up to Christmas women will still have the opportunity to purchase their life insurance at prices that are 25% cheaper compared to their male counterparts. So ladies, if you have a family and you are thinking of taking out life insurance - bag yourself a bargain at the lower price and buy your cover before the Gender Directive comes into force on 21 December 2012.  <a href="https://www.irishlife.ie/secureWeb/life-assurance/eu-gender-directive-with-quote.html">Click here</a> to get a quote for Life Insurance now.

It may be an unusual present, but it could be the one thing your family will appreciate the most.

<strong>Note:</strong> Under the Gender Directive the move to gender neutral pricing applies to new plans started after 21 December 2012. Once you start a plan such as term life insurance or mortgage protection before that date, your price is fixed for the term of the plan.

<title>MythBusters: 97% of Life Insurance Death Claims Are Paid</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[iReach Consumer Omnibus Research helps us understand people's thoughts about Life Insurance in Ireland.

- 40% of people think that life companies decline 50% of claims for Life Cover and Specified Illness Cover

- 16% think they decline 75%+ of claims for Life Cover and Specified Illness Cover.

- 20% of males believe that 75%+ claims for Life and Specified Illness Cover are declined as opposed to 14% of females.

The truth is quite different at Irish Life. We pay claims. In 2011 Irish Life paid out 97% of all Life Insurance Death Claims and 90% of all Specified Illness Cover claims. 6,241 death claims paid have been paid by Irish Life since 2007. That adds up to €386.6m paid out to families. In 2011 alone we paid out €81.5m.

<title>Changes to Pensions in Budget 2013</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[While there isn't much good news in Budget 2013 (property tax, more DIRT, and on and on) Irish Life does welcome the commitment by the Government to continue to provide incentives for middle income people to pay into their pensions to save for their retirement.

We think that capping tax relief benefits on pensions over €60K p.a. is a much fairer solution than reducing tax relief for everyone.

The early release scheme for Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVC) is also good news. This allows people to withdraw - subject to marginal tax rate - up to 30% of the value of their AVC fund. This will be available for 3 years following the passing of the Finance Act.

The commitment not to renew the Pension Levy after 2014 is also welcomed.

More commentary to follow ....]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Information on Imputed Distribution ... for customers with ARFs and Vested PRSAs.</h1>
&#160;

The Finance Act 2006 introduced a minimum annual withdrawal amount on Approved Retirement Funds (ARFs) and from 2012, Vested Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSA). These are called Imputed Distributions and Irish Life pays these to our customers in December each year.

&#160;

We've put together a booklet for our ARF customers explaining in the simplest terms everything you need to know about your Imputed Distribution payment.

&#160;

Download the booklet at <a title="Imputed Distribution Guide" href="http://www.irishlife.ie/uploadedFiles/Retail/body/products/Pensions/imputed-distribution.pdf" target="_blank">irishlife.ie</a>. (PDF opens in a new window).

<strong><em><span style="color: #993300;">Yep, 'tis the season to be jolly! Time to dust down those Christmas decorations and turn your house into a magical wonderland!</span></em></strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><strong><em><span style="color: #993300;">To ensure you have a safe holiday this festive season, see below some hints and tips for Fire Safety at Christmas, to ensure you and yours are protected this Christmas!</span></em></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Christmas Trees</span></strong></div>
<div>• Place real Christmas trees securely in a sturdy base filled with water – metal stands cause trees to dry out and become flammable
• Check water level daily
• Ensure artificial trees have been pre-treated to increase flame resistance
• Keep tree away from candles, heaters, fireplaces or other heat sources
• Dispose of tree properly – never burn a real tree in the fireplace
• View a <a title="This link will open in a new window" href="http://fire.nist.gov/tree_fire.htm" target="_blank">video that demonstrates how quickly the fire can develop when a DRY tree is exposed to an open flame</a>.</div>

<h3></h3>
&#160;
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Christmas Lights</span></h3>
&#160;
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Indoors</strong> </span></h4>
• Only buy Christmas lights marked with a safety standard
• Make sure a competent person checks all connections and examines the wiring for fraying
• If in doubt, throw them out.
• Don’t overload sockets
• Unplug all Christmas lights and electrical appliances before leaving your home or going to bed
<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Outdoors</strong></span>

• Ensure lights are suitable for outdoor use
• Check all wiring and follow manufacturers instructions.
• Fasten the bulbs securely and point the sockets down to avoid moisture building up.
• Never use indoor extension leads outside.
• Keep outdoor electrical connections above ground and out of puddles and snow.
• Ensure trees hung with Christmas lights are not touching power lines
<h4></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Candles</strong></span></h4>
An Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs (ODCA) survey found that consumers are exposed to serious risk due to the lack of advice when using candles and candle-holders. Of the 482 items inspected 117 or 24.3% failed a visual risk assessment either due to lack of warnings, warnings not provided in English or because the items clearly presented a safety hazard.

Remember when it comes to candles:

• Keep them out of reach of children and pets
• Trim the wick to 6mm (1/4 inch) each time before burning
• Always use an appropriate candleholder placed on a stable, heat-resistant surface
• Keep burning candles away from drafts, vents and air currents
• Extinguish a candle if it smokes or flickers repeatedly or if the flame becomes too high
• Keep the wax pool free of wick trimmings, matches and debris at all times
• Do not burn a candle for longer than manufacturer recommends
• Extinguish the flame if it comes too close to the holder or container
• Place lighted candles at least 75mm apart form one another
• Never place a candle on top of a TV set and keep well away from curtains
• Always extinguish candles before leaving the house or going to bed
• Never use candles on Christmas trees, even artificial ones
• Remember hot wax burns!
<h4></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;">Other Christmas Fire Safety Tips</span></h4>
<div>• Never burn wrapping paper in your fireplace
• Keep strings of Christmas cards away from candles and open fires
• Fit a spark guard in front of open fires
• Extinguish cigarettes properly and do not let ashtrays get overfilled
• Check that your smoke alarms are in perfect working order
• Never remove batteries from smoke alarm to use in children’s toys
• Clean out the oven and stove prior to Christmas</div>

<em><span style="color: #993300"><strong>Some tips to help ensure your home is secure over the festive season:</strong></span></em>

Searched the internet and there are lots of information as to keep your home safe this Christmas, a selection of these are listed below:

<span style="color: #993300"><strong>Festive lighting - be secure</strong></span>. A common mistake of many festive decorators is to feed extension cables through partially open windows, criminals know to look for this vulnerability. When it comes to outdoor lighting, opt for solar or battery operated lights or install outdoor electrical outlets.

<span style="color: #993300"><strong>Dispose of gift packaging carefully.</strong></span> Refuse collections over the Christmas and New Year period are normally at different times. If you can't take packaging to a recycling point, make sure you only put your rubbish out just before the collection and do your best to break apart boxes so that they do not advertise your new contents of your home to thieves!

<span style="color: #993300"><strong>Be careful not to advertise your home to burglars on social media!</strong></span> Social media savvy families have a tendency to publish their whereabouts during the holiday season, including any vacation plans. This lets burglars know when your house is going to be empty. Uploaded photos of pricey Christmas gifts can also be a problem as it basically allows burglars to go shopping just by viewing your Facebook profile.

<span style="color: #993300"><strong>Check doors and windows for weak spots</strong></span>. Installing a few dead-bolts and new window hinges could increase the security of your home exponentially.

<span style="color: #993300"><strong>Keep your curtains, drapes and window blinds closed at night</strong></span>, making sure valuable items are out of sight. When going out for the evening make use of inexpensive timers to give the illusion of occupancy.

<span style="color: #993300"><strong>Away over Christmas - plan ahead!!</strong></span>. If you're going away at Christmas be sure to cancel any newspaper or milk subscriptions. Arrange for a neighbour to park on the driveway to help create the impression someone is home. Do not to leave descriptive telephone answering machine messages or and again make use of light timers.

<span style="color: #993300"><strong>Secure garages &amp; sheds</strong>.</span> Make sure that garden tools or ladders that could be used to force entry into your home are not left lying around or accessible from an unlocked garden shed. Garages are often targets for burglars looking for tools, bikes and gardening equipment - make sure the garage is secure and your possessions are secured too in the case of bikes and tools. Naturally make sure anything portable / valuable is recorded on immobilise.

<span style="color: #993300"><strong>Don't hide keys &amp; use alarms if you have them</strong>.</span> Burglars know to look for hidden door keys so don't hide spare keys under rocks, in flowerpots, or above door ledges. Instead give the spare key to family or trusted neighbour. Many houses these days have alarms, many though are rarely set, make sure yours is on and protecting your home.

An Garda Síochána have lots of useful information covering all areas of personal safety/burglary prevention: <!--StartFragment--><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=1921&amp;Lang=1">http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=1921&amp;Lang=1</a></span></span></span> <!--EndFragment-->

Below is one of the information sheets found on the link above.. I challenge all to do the check list, just how many 'No's' will you get?

&#160;

<strong>An Garda Síochána </strong><strong>Crime Prevention Information Sheet</strong>

Burglars like easy opportunities. If they have to make a lot of noise, spend a lot of time or risk being seen, the chances are they won’t bother. A good rule of thumb is the 3 minute delay test. If you can deny entry for 3 min- utes or more – chances are the burglars will go elsewhere. Complete this simple home security survey to deter- mine how well your home is secured against burglary. Ignore questions not relevant to your own home.

Remember, every NO answer is a threat to your home security.

<strong>Doors and Windows</strong>
<ol>
<li>Are all your external doors properly fitted and equipped with appropriate secure locking sys- tems? (i.e. 5-lever mortice locks for wooden doors, multi-point locking for uPVC doors etc.)</li>
<li>If you have glass panelled doors – are they reinforced in some way so that they cannot be shattered?</li>
<li>Have you a wide-angled viewer in your front/main entrance doors or other means of viewing callers?</li>

<li>Since moving into your home (where there may have been a previous occupier) have you had the locks changed?</li>
<li>Are your spare keys kept with a trusted neighbour and never left under an external mat, flower pot etc.</li>
<li>Do you lock your external doors when away from home, no matter how short a time?</li>
<li>Do you lock the doors out of your view when working in the garden / yard?</li>
<li>Have you installed an additional lock(s) to your sliding glass / patio doors?</li>
<li>Can you close and lock your garage / outhouse doors?</li>
<li>Are the garage / outhouse doors protected with quality locks or deadbolts?</li>
<li>Do you close and lock your garage /outhouse doors?</li>
<li>Are all your windows secure?</li>
<li>Can the window openings be restricted for ventilation?</li>

<li>Have you recorded serial numbers of your valuables?</li>
<li>Have you, for identification purposes, photographed your valuables especially items for which you have no serial numbers such as jewellery, china, crystal, paintings, antiques etc?</li>
<li>Are your car / house keys kept in a location not visible from the outside?</li>
</ol>
&#160;

<strong>Outside Security</strong>
<ol>
<li>Is your house number visible from the street?</li>
<li>Is there sufficient illumination around your home to allow visible inspection of any dark areas around it?</li>
<li>Is there sufficient external lighting outside every door to illuminate visitors?</li>
<li>Do neighbours and passers-by have a clear view of your home?</li>
<li>Have you trimmed all hedges and shrubs so they can’t hide a burglar at work on the windows and doors?</li>
<li>Have you ever walked around your house looking for ways a burglar might be able to get in?</li>
<li>Do you keep tools or ladders etc. in places inaccessible to potential burglars?</li>
<li>Are machines, tools and other high value items stored in garages or sheds securely padlocked or chained to prevent removal?</li>
<li>Is your shed / garage secure?</li>
</ol>
&#160;

<strong>Holiday Security</strong>
<ol>
<li>Have you a reliable neighbour whom you can notify of your travel plans and give a key to, with a request for a periodic house check?</li>
<li>Do you have a neighbour collect your mail or newspapers when you are away or do you avail of Mailminder from An Post?</li>
<li>Do you cancel all deliveries?</li>
<li>Do you have your neighbour park his / her extra car in your driveway when you are away from home?</li>
<li> Do you arrange to have your lawn mowed?</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We often hear about the tragic deaths on our roads, but rarely hear about the survivors of road accidents, who are left with serious injuries and require lifelong support and attention. Did you know that 19,681 people have suffered serious injuries on our roads between 1996 and 2011?

<strong><span style="color: #993300">Be safe this Christmas...  SLOW DOWN, DO NOT DRINK AND DRIVE, AND ALWAYS WEAR YOUR SEATBELT!</span></strong>

Below is the recent press release from the RSA and An Garda Síochána. Elaine Hanley's story is one that brings the statistics to life, it could happen to any of us, as Elaine mentions herself, we really need to take great care when out on the roads!

<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/RSA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1920" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/RSA-300x60.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="60" /></a>

<strong>Press Release</strong>

<strong> 10 December 2012</strong>

<strong> </strong>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #993300"><strong>LAUNCH OF CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR ROAD SAFETY CAMPAIGN</strong></span></p>
&#160;

The Road Safety Authority (RSA) and An Garda Síochána today launched their Christmas and New Year Road Safety Campaign in collaboration with the National Spinal Injuries Unit in the Mater Hospital. The focus of this year’s campaign is serious injuries as a result of collisions as statistics showed that 19,681 people were seriously injured in a collision in the period 1996 to 2011.

A further analysis of the statistics shows that the number of serious injuries has decreased in recent years, in line with the reduction in road fatalities, with the lowest number of serious injuries recorded in 2011 (440)*. This was echoed in the presentation given by Mr Keith Synnott, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon at the Mater Hospital who said that in the past, most spinal cord injuries admitted to the hospital were as a result of road collisions (up to 50% in many studies), but that this had significantly reduced in recent years.

Speaking at the launch today, Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr Leo Varadkar TD said: “Last year we had the lowest number of deaths and serious injuries on our roads since records began. Nevertheless, we must continue with efforts to reduce the toll even further. Today I visited the National Spinal Injuries Unit in the Mater Hospital, where the members of staff are doing extraordinary work to support patients recovering from spinal cord injuries. This visit puts into perspective the simple things we all take for granted. And it serves as a sharp reminder of why we should all strive for road safety, particularly over the festive period.”

In his presentation, Mr Keith Synnott, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, Mater Hospital also presented hospital data from the past two years which showed a considerable reduction in the number of spinal injuries presenting themselves to the Unit as a result of road collisions. "We are delighted to be able to collaborate with the RSA and An Garda Síochána by hosting this launch at the Mater Hospital and the National Spinal Injuries Unit. Spinal cord injuries have a devastating and truly life changing impact on people who suffer them and their families. Unfortunately in many cases the damage to the spinal cord and its consequences are irreversible,” said Mr Synnott.

“The highly skilled multidisciplinary team that work with these patients in the Mater are dedicated to helping patients survive these injuries, to prevent further injury and disease in these complex and challenging cases and to help them begin the often long and difficult road to rehabilitation. The goal of treatment is often to help patients maximise the function that remains following their injury. In spinal cord injury the old adage that prevention is better than cure is never more apt and it is with this in mind that we hope that this launch will encourage people to take care on the roads over Christmas and heed the message of the RSA and An Garda Síochána.”

At the launch, Mr Gay Byrne, Chairman, Road Safety Authority reminded people not to forget those who have been seriously injured in collisions: “When we hear or read about road collisions, more often than not, it’s because someone has died. But what we often forget are those who are seriously injured in these collisions. It’s estimated that for every death on EU roads, there are at least eight serious injuries such as spinal cord injuries, as we have heard today, severe brain damage and injuries that require lifelong support and attention.”

“As we enter the final days of 2012 and the beginning of a new year, I want us to all to remember these people and to remember that all it takes is a split second for a serious injury or worse to happen. Our message, as always, is simple – don’t take risks on the road. Slow down, wear your seatbelt, never ever drink or drug drive and make sure you get home safely this Christmas.”

Over the festive period, there will be a determined focus by An Garda Síochána on high risk behaviour such as excessive and inappropriate speed, drink and drug driving and the non-wearing of seatbelts.

Speaking at the launch, Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan said: “An Garda Síochána, through the Traffic Corps, is committed to working with all of the agencies involved in road safety to ensure we minimise the tragic impact of road collisions, be it a death or a serious injury. As such, over the festive period, we will be dedicating our resources to stamping out irresponsible, risky behaviour on our roads. But I would like to remind everyone that this is not about catching people, it’s about protecting each and every person who uses the roads so that we can all have a safe and happy Christmas and New Year.”

At the launch, Elaine Hanley spoke about how her life has changed since she was in a collision last year.  “Last year, I was a typical 23 year old girl. I was working as a nurse in a care of the elderly hospital, hoping to do further study in the field of geriatrics. I enjoyed going out with friends, going for walks with my dog and helping my family with the farm. Then in August 2011, my life changed. I was in a collision and when I woke up, I was in the Mater Hospital with a spinal injury that left me paralysed from the chest down. The turnaround from being a nurse to being a patient, literally overnight, was overwhelming.”

Elaine added “My life has completely changed for my family and me since that day in August. Living with a serious injury is a daily struggle and life, will never be the same again. Nobody ever thinks they will be in a crash or that something so serious could happen to them but it can. So I would like people to realise that we are so fragile when on the roads and that we really need to take great care.”

A total of 154 people have been killed in road collisions to date in 2012 compared to 174 deaths to the same date in 2011. This represents 20 fewer deaths this year compared to last. When broken down by road-user, this represents 78 drivers, 25 passengers, 23 pedestrians, 16 motorcyclists and 8 cyclists who have died on Irish roads to date this year.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well that was quick wasn't it? No sooner had we said Happy Christmas to our friends and families, and we are now into the new year. And with the new year normally comes the fear, the fear of trying to get back into shape after the Christmas festivities.
<blockquote>Why did I not just go for a walk rather than watching Willy Wonka for the 42nd time</blockquote>
Everyone over-indulges a bit over the Christmas period, and when January comes rolling around, you can be rolling after it. The first time you pull on the runners for a jog or a visit to the gym can bring about the sweats even just thinking about it. Flashbacks of empty miniature hero wrappers scattered across the living room floor, that second Christmas dinner eaten at 7 pm on Christmas night, the beer, the wine, the crisps, why oh why did I let myself do it. Why did I not just go for a walk rather than watching Willy Wonka for the 42nd time, why did I have the 2nd bowl of sherry trifle when I didn't even need the first one!

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Are newspapers attempting to destroy the web or vice-versa?</h2>
&#160;

There's some discussion on the web this week - but notably not in Irish Newspapers - regarding the
National Newspapers of Ireland's (NNI) desire to charge people and organisations for linking to their content. Not copying, not reproducing, not syndicating, just linking to a page. The <a title="National Newspapers of Ireland" href="http://www.nni.ie" target="_blank">NNI</a> is the representative body for most of the Irish Newspapers.

This came to light after the NNI wrote to a charity, Women's Aid, asking them to pay for links to articles on Irish Times website.

This is part of a review of existing Copyright legislation by the Copyright Review Committee under the Dept. of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.

While this has gotten significant coverage internationally throughout the week (<a title="New York Observer" href="http://betabeat.com/2012/05/charity-asked-to-pay-for-linking-to-newspaper-website" target="_blank">New York Observer</a> , <a title="Techcrunch" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/29/doing-it-wrong-irish-newspaper-licensing-organization-asks-womens-charity-to-pay-for-links/" target="_blank">Techcrunch</a> to name but two) , it doesn't seem to be newsworthy for Irish Newspapers. Indeed, it finally got mainstream coverage in Ireland this morning (Friday, 4th Jan) on <a title="Morning Ireland" href="http://www.rte.ie/news/morningireland/player.html?20130104,20133987,20133987,flash,232" target="_blank">RTE Radio 1</a>.

&#160;
<h2><em><strong>This is not new</strong></em></h2>
This has a precedent - in 2007 a Belgian court ruled that Google's news search infringed copyright law, forcing it to remove links and snippets of articles from French and German language newspaper websites.

This dispute was eventually resolved with both sides claiming victory, although the likelihood is that traffic to the websites suffered when they were being excluded from search results pages. Read more here on <a title="Google Blog" href="http://www.googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.ie/2012/12/partnering-with-belgian-news-publishers.html" target="_blank">Google Blog</a> and<a title="Bloomberg" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-13/google-belgian-newspapers-settle-copyright-dispute-over-links.html" target="_blank"> Bloomberg</a>.

&#160;
<h2><em><strong>More links to your site is good, right?</strong></em></h2>
Competing news sites and news aggregators aside, I would have thought that newspapers would be encouraging links to their sites. More links means more visits and more visits means more <a title="Ad impressions" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impression_%28online_media%29" target="_blank">ad impressions</a>. More impressions means more revenue.

If NNI are attempting to charge for linking to content then why do news sites like <em>Irish Independent</em>, <em>Irish Times</em> and <em>Irish Examiner</em> have share buttons beside every article? And not just to share on Facebook on Twitter, but also blogging platforms such as Tumblr, Blogger and Wordpress.

&#160;
<h2><em><strong>Do I want to pay for this?</strong></em></h2>
Going down the road of charging for links will force everyone to ask themselves - "is this worth paying for?". Online subscription models have not worked for the most part for newspapers, only large papers like the NY Times or The Times have a large enough readership to possibly make this work. If it has been shown that people aren't prepared to pay subscriptions, then it's safe to assume that they won't pay for mere hyperlinks.

I presume that NNI would be going after Google too as they not only have links to content, but in many cases Google stores actual content and produces this in search results. If Google won't play ball the NNI sites could end up isolated from the rest of the web and that will not end nicely.

&#160;
<h2><em><strong>Getting some attention</strong></em></h2>
Hugh Linehan, editor of Irish Times has been in conversation on his personal Twitter today regarding the issue. He has made the following encouraging comments -

<title>We paid out over €125 million in Life insurance claims last year</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[In January of each New Year, we like to take a look back at the year that was, and publish details of our customers’ Life Insurance claims experience from the previous year.

The figures reveal that in 2012 Irish Life paid out a total of €83.5 million in Life Insurance benefits held by 1,168 customers. A further €41.5m was paid out to 606 customers in respect of Specified Illness Cover plans.
<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/death.claims.stat_.2012.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2060" title="Death Claims Paid By Irish Life by year" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/death.claims.stat_.2012.png" alt="Death Claims Paid By Irish Life by year" width="542" height="358" /></a>
Our largest payout last year, a €5 million Life Insurance payment is the highest made by Irish Life in the past 7 years and compares to the highest claim paid in 2011 of €700,000. Indeed, this was just one of a number of claims north of €1 million paid out last year.

The average claim for Life Insurance however was just over €71,500, and the fact that the average payment was just €71,500 suggests that the level of Life Insurance taken out by many Irish people is still insufficient to look after their dependents in the event of an early death, especially as the average age of adult claims is 62.

Death and Specified Illness Cover is one of the best value financial products available. This sort of financial protection is just as important for those on lower incomes as it is for those on higher incomes. Last year we paid a €69,800 death benefit in respect of a Special Needs Assistant and a Specified Illness Cover payment of over €220,000 in respect of a young Home Care Assistant who contracted Multiple Sclerosis. It’s probably fair to say that the payments to those customers are probably more significant to them and their dependents than some substantially bigger claims we settled for customers on much higher incomes.

Cancer and heart-related conditions continue to account for a majority of death and Specified Illness Cover claims. Cancer accounted for 46% of death claims and 63% of Specified Illness Cover claims, while heart conditions accounted for 14% of death and 19% of Specified Illness Cover claims. Cancer was the cause of 56% of death claims involving females and 43% involving males, while heart conditions were the cause of almost one-in-five of claims involving males compared to just 7% involving females.

Accidents accounted for 135 Life Insurance claims – 12% of the total – and these were concentrated heavily among younger people with 40% of all Life Insurance claims for customers under age 40 the result of an accident. A total of 21 Life Insurance claims were the result of a road traffic accident. Alcohol was a factor in 7% of all accident claims. There has been a welcome improvement in the incidence of alcohol as a factor in accidents from 14% in 2011 to 7% last year and I hope to see a further improvement in the current year.

Keep an eye on the website, as in the coming days we'll be producing our 2012 claims map, which gives a county by county breakdown of our claims paid.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Another year has passed and it has seen an exceptional response from Irish Life staff with a massive €70,000 raised. This will be matched by the company and given to the two charities voted for by Irish Life staff, namely <a href="http://www.imnda.ie/" target="_blank">IMNDA</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.facebook.com/espwa.haiti" target="_blank">Haiti Orphanage Project ESPWA</a>

Each year staff select two Irish charities, one who do their work in Ireland and the other who do their work abroad. The charities are voted for by staff, and are typically a charity where there is an affiliation, directly or indirectly, with that charity.

<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/charities-Pic-6.jpg"><img src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/charities-Pic-6.jpg" alt="Charities Cheque presentation 1" width="550" height="381" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2122" /></a>

Since 1996 Irish Life staff have donated €1.25m to their selected charities through various (and imaginative) fund raising events organized by their Staff Charities committee. These have included fashion shows, fake weddings, walking a mile in her shoes, abseiling down their 9-storey building, skipping through lunch (conveniently called "Skip-Lunch"), and Copper Kilo, where 200kg's of coppers were collected, to name but a few!

2012 was no exception.  We utilized the Euro 2012 football finals to raise funds through Jersey days, and prediction competitions.  The ever lucrative book sales have seen some of the popular books turn into money making machines, as they keep coming back for re-sale once people finish reading them!  Also on the events calendar was a fun run along the quays at lunch time, and back to the office for a cake sale, just to replace all those burned calories!

There are normally a couple of big events during the year. This year is no different.  After a 3 year gap, we teamed up with White Collar Boxing once again for another showdown in the squared circle, giving some staff the opportunity to step into the ring to (safely) take on one of their colleagues in a boxing match. The event took place in a full sized boxing ring assembled in the staff restaurant and was titled the "Rumble in the Restaurant II - unfinished business"

<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Charity-Pic-3.jpg"><img src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Charity-Pic-3.jpg" alt="Charity Cheque Presentation 3" width="550" height="371" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2124" /></a>

30 members of staff, both male and female, spent 10 weeks getting in shape and learning the basic skills to step into the ring and battle it out, all in the name of charity! The grueling training regime took place at the National Boxing Stadium. There was added excitement and motivation at one of the sessions, as the participants got to meet Katie Taylor and Paddy Barnes just back from their heroic achievement in the Excel Arena at London 2012 Olympic Games. Aoife Murphy, one of the boxers on the night couldn't resist the photo opportunity!  The event took place at the end of September, so by now the bruised bodies (and in some cases, bruised egos) should be recovered, and people are back speaking to each other again.

The other big event saw the Staff Restaurant turn into a fabulous Winter Wonderland for the Staff Charities Christmas Party. While this was a great fundraiser, it also gave the Staff Charities Committee an opportunity to say thank you to everyone for their generous donations during the year.

Lastly, the final and most important event was the cheque handover over to both charities, which is normally the proudest moment for the staff and the committee, as they get a chance to see or hear how the money they have raised is going to be used to improve the lives of many people.

<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Charity-Pic-4.jpg"><img src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Charity-Pic-4.jpg" alt="Charity Cheque presentation 2" width="552" height="390" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2123" /></a>

Looking forward to 2013, when we can do it all over again... We have some ideas already....]]></content:encoded>

<title>We’re giving away €500 million worth of Life Insurance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<br/>
One of the things we’re always banging on about here in Irish Life is just how important it really is to have Life Insurance, and just how few Irish people actually have a life insurance  plan in place. 

So we’ve decided to do something about it. Starting from today, we will give cover of €25,000 for a year to 20,000 adults. The offer is available <a href="http://www.irishlife.ie/" title="irishlife">online</a>, and through brokers and financial advisers.

In addition, we’ve published some research on customer attitudes to life insurance. The key findings from the survey of 1000 people were:


<blockquote>• That 60% of adults in Ireland do not have life insurance which often means that dependents could face significant financial problems in the event of their death.</blockquote>


<blockquote>• That 56% of people say they could struggle financially in the event that something would happen to them.  This is an increase of 10% (from 46% to 56%) from March 2011.</blockquote>


<blockquote>• That 34% of adults assume the cost of cover is significantly more expensive than it typically is – they assume that €100,000 of cover will cost more than €50 a month. Whereas in fact for €100,000 cover with our Term Life Insurance plan the price could be less than a third of that amount  -  just €15 per month for an adult aged 40 or younger, over a 10 year term who is a non-smoker and is in good health. </blockquote>

<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/FreeOfferIrishLife56-e1360150574561.jpg"><img src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/FreeOfferIrishLife56-e1360150574561.jpg" alt="FreeOfferIrishLife56" width="503" height="353" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2106" /></a>

Life Insurance should be at the core of every family’s financial planning.  Last year Irish Life paid out €83m in death claims to 1,168 families.   However what may surprise people is that over half of this amount, €45m, was paid in respect of people younger than 55 years old, which is the upper age limit on our Free Parent Insurance promotion.  Many of these customers had young families who would have been left financially stranded if they didn’t have life insurance in place and that’s why we’re encouraging all parents to consider whether their family is protected.    As well as giving 20,000 parents an extra layer of cover for a year, this promotion highlights the affordability and the benefits of life insurance in the event of a family being faced with a crisis.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[&#160;

Great-West Lifeco, the parent company of Canada Life in Ireland, has announced that following negotiations with the Irish Government, it has reached agreement to acquire Irish Life.

[caption id="attachment_2141" align="aligncenter" width="380"]<img class="size-full wp-image-2141" alt="Kevin Murphy, Group Chief Executive, Irish Life; Michael Noonan, Minister for Finance; Allen Loney, President and CEO, Great-West Lifeco." src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/kevin-michael-allen-2.jpg" width="380" height="253" /> Kevin Murphy, Group Chief Executive, Irish Life; Michael Noonan, Minister for Finance; Allen Loney, President and CEO, Great-West Lifeco.[/caption]

The transaction is a major vote of confidence in Ireland and will be one of the largest overseas investments ever in the Irish Financial Services sector.
<blockquote>"A transformational deal for our respective businesses in Ireland and for our customers" - Kevin Murphy, Group Chief Executive, Irish Life</blockquote>
It's also very good news for Irish Life customers.  Great-West Lifeco is one of the strongest life assurance companies in the world, with €417 billion of assets under administration.  They are rated AA (Very Strong) by independent ratings agencies Fitch and Standard &amp; Poors.  This financial strength provides an additional layer of reassurance for the Irish Life customers.

<strong>Future developments</strong>

The transaction is expected to close by the end of Quarter 2, 2013 and is subject to regulatory approvals.

Great-West Lifeco has confirmed that following the transaction the life and pensions operations of Irish Life and Canada Life in Ireland will come together as one combined business, which will operate under the Irish Life brand name. With access to experience and expertise on a global scale, we plan to create a life and pensions company with world class products, customer service and technology to meet your changing needs.

Please be assured that your plans with Irish Life will be completely unaffected by this change, and that customers of both organisations will have continuity of products and customer service under Irish Life. As we bring the two companies together, our number one priority is to make sure we take care of our customers and continue to provide outstanding customer service.

Thank you for choosing Irish Life to look after your financial needs and we look forward to continuing to serve you in future as part of Great-West Lifeco, one of the world’s leading life assurance companies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<br/>Here’s a little exercise for you: open up your Facebook and log in. Go to your timeline and count the number of posts or photos that have been shared to your timeline by your friends. Now look at those again and identify the number of those that could be considered 'like and share' competitions. 

By this, I mean those which make 'liking' and 'sharing' the post a condition of entry. On an average day, my timeline is filled with friends, family, casual acquaintances alike, all liking and sharing Facebook pages for no other reason than to be in with a chance of winning something free. Why wouldn't they! At time of writing, a quick look at my own timeline and I can see 3 examples. I’d say that’s typical.


[caption id="attachment_2150" align="aligncenter" width="480"]<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/condescendingbrandpage.jpg"><img src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/condescendingbrandpage.jpg" alt="Picture taken from Condescending Brand page Link" width="480" height="480" class="size-full wp-image-2150" /></a> Picture taken from Condescending Brand page: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/corporatebollocks">Link</a>[/caption]


All of these competitions are in violation of Facebook’s terms of business. Facebook’s response to this type of activity, when made aware of it, is to remove your page.  Worse than that, these competitions don’t really work and may be harming your business’ reputation. This type of promotion spams people’s timelines with unwanted and irrelevant content.  And if you’re a small business owner or an online marketer, do you really want to be <em>that</em> guy? 

<strong>So why do it?</strong>
The default raison d’etre for these types of competition is to build Facebook likes on your page. And what’s the harm I hear you say? - We get more likes on our page and somebody gets a nice prize... - Well actually, the harm is twofold;

<strong>You can<em> like and share</em> a post without actually <em>liking </em>the page.</strong>
And I mean this both metaphorically and literally. You’ve heard it a thousand times before; any organization embarking on social media marketing must develop some specific goals from the outset. What do you want to achieve, and why do you want to achieve that? Social media has fantastic power as an engagement platform, but the goal has to be meaningful engagement. Someone liking your post just to be in with a chance of winning a prize isn't necessarily interested in your offering. A 'like' should be treated as a means to an end, a signal of genuine interest in what you have to say. It should not be an end in itself.

And to state the obvious; Facebookers 'liking and sharing' a competition post from their own newsfeed need never even visit your page, let alone 'like' it! 

<strong>The Lives of Others</strong>
The second problem concerns those who don't enter your competition; the Facebook friends of those who've 'liked and shared' your post. What impression are they likely to form of the organization filling their newsfeeds with unwanted, irrelevant, spammy, annoying and unoriginal content? 

When you look at the bottom of a post on your Facebook page and see that ‘X people saw this post’, it’s worth considering what their reaction to it was; If these potential customers view your posts as getting in the way of the stuff they really want to see, are you really better off for having reached them?

[caption id="attachment_2152" align="aligncenter" width="522"]<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/justsayno.png"><img src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/justsayno.png" alt="Spam." width="522" height="483" class="size-full wp-image-2152" /></a> Spam.[/caption]

<strong>So are all competitions bad?</strong>
Hell no! In Irish life we run competitions all the time on our Facebook page, and we think they are a great way to build engagement and reach people we might not ordinarily reach. The key is to design content that people want to share. Personally I love to see people 'commenting in' their friends in the comments below a post; this tells me they've thought about who might be interested, and <strong>specifically</strong> included them. 

<strong>Bottom Line</strong>
Facebook relationships are a social graph, not an interest graph. Friends and family do not necessarily share interests, but most Facebookers are willing to tolerate a certain degree of unwanted content from friends in their newsfeed, because of the overall value that Facebook holds for them.

This is not a bountiful well of tolerance, and the minute users start to feel their timeline is being hijacked by content whose express objective is to do just that, you've lost. To make matters worse, this is bad business for Facebook and they will eventually lash out against this type of activity in a more ruthless way than they have to date. When that day comes pages that are caught in the crossfire, either through ignorance of the rules or risk taking, will have nowhere to turn to.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well done, Irish Life, for highlighting this. You're right, asking people to like &amp; share a page, as a condition of entry to a competition, is indeed in breach of Facebook rules &amp; regulations, and not only that, it is annoying. You're completely right in everything you've said here.
I would say up to 40% of the posts on my newsfeed daily consist of "like &amp; share" competitions. I find them very irritating but at the same time, they are usually posted by my friends, so I don't like to be rude by replying to them saying that this sort of thing is against FB rules and is annoying me! So instead, I'm going to share your post and get my message across in a more subtle way, thanks! ;o)]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA["They saw you coming!"

My wife on hearing how much I’d agreed to pay for our new double-glazing.

I recently got around to buying two things that had been on the “family to-do” list for ages. Our windows had been in the house when we moved in almost 15 years ago and I’d managed to kid myself I was saving money by putting that off – I probably spent twice as much in lost heating. And two weeks ago I finally bought a new car.  I say new in the “new to me” but old to the person who had put nearly 100,000 kilometres on the clock. Still it means that I get to be the weekend taxi service for my kids’ soccer, football, basketball, piano and tennis activities.

Anyway what I found funny was my son’s reaction – “why would you buy a car that’s almost 7 years old and why didn’t you get that Audi TT that you always wanted!”.  He was right. I really did want the TT – the mind wondered again for a minute thinking about the soft-top with the roof down and the wind blowing through the hair.  This beautiful moment was interrupted by “What hair Dad?”.  Anyway I had bought an Audi ….A3 and it would do the job!
<blockquote>That’s a lot of people walking around carrying a huge financial risk for their families, possibly for as little as €15 a month?</blockquote>
&#160;

It got me thinking about that old discussion about what’s more important  – the price of the good or service itself or the value that you’ll ultimately derive from it.   And how do people put a value on things that they’re not really buying for themselves but for someone else, such as their family.

For example our customer research shows us that people think Life insurance is twice as expensive as it actually is. That’s why over 3 in 5 people, such as young parents, think that they won’t be able to afford it. That’s a lot of people walking around carrying a huge financial risk for their families, possibly for as little as €15 a month?

[caption id="attachment_2177" align="aligncenter" width="350"]<a href="https://www.irishlife.ie/secureWeb/life-assurance/life-insurance-quote-from-15-per-month.html" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-2177     " style="border: 2px solid black; margin: 2px;" alt="Try our Life Insurance Calculator today" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/calculator-300x284.png" width="350" height="322" /></a> Try our Life Insurance Calculator today[/caption]

That’s why we’ve been trying to encourage parents over the last year to take a look for themselves and see what great value life insurance really is.  For example for just €15 a month a 35 year old could buy over €125,000 of life insurance for 20 years with our Term Insurance Plan.  Of course as with all life insurance the price you pay will depend on your health.  You can use our straight-forward <a href="https://www.irishlife.ie/secureWeb/life-assurance/life-insurance-quote-from-15-per-month.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">life insurance tool</span></a> to see how much cover you could get for €15 a month – it’ll only take you a couple of minutes.

I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised – it’ll be one more item to mark off the family “to-do” list]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So we are into the month of May, into the Summer, although you wouldn't think it by looking out the window.  With the increase in temperatures comes also an increase in the risk of Melanoma or Skin Cancer.

May is National Melanoma Awareness month, and unfortunately it is a condition that is on the rise in this country.  Even though there is no comparison with the weather, more people now die of Melanoma in the UK than in Australia.

The infographic below shows some facts about claims paid out by Irish Life for Malignant Melanoma cases for the last five years.  Click on image to enlarge.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/melanoma-infograph.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2195 aligncenter" alt="melanoma infograph" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/melanoma-infograph-96x300.jpg" width="96" height="300" /></a></p>
Like all forms of Cancer, prevention is much better than seeking a cure, and the Irish Cancer Society have some useful tips on their <a href="http://www.cancer.ie/cancer-information/melanoma/causes-prevention" target="_blank">website</a> to help to prevent contracting the disease.
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li> Avoid the sun between 11am and 3pm</li>
<li>Wear protective clothing</li>
<li>Always wear sunscreen, apply every 2 hours, more often if swimming or perspiring</li>
<li>Avoid tanning beds or sunbeds</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Do I need illness and life insurance?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Consider this story ...
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><i>Mr &amp; Mrs Smith are an affluent couple in late 30’s/early 40's. They have 6 children – 3 biological, 3 adopted. He is an actor and she is involved in humanitarian causes. They both look incredibly healthy. They were approached several years ago about life &amp; illness cover but their Financial Advisor was unable to explain the value of this to them.</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><i>Then disaster struck. Mrs Smith’s mother died of ovarian cancer at age 56. Mrs Smith then decided to take a predictive genetic test to see whether she carried the mutated genes. On confirmation that she did carry the gene responsible for breast cancer, Mrs Smith took the incredibly difficult decision to take preventative measures through bilateral mastectomy (surgery to remove both breasts). </i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><i>According to the medical statistics, while only about 5% of breast cancers can be directly attributed to a family history of breast cancer, if you are in this particular risk category, then the</i><i> </i><i>chances are unfortunately high that you will develop breast cancer.</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><i>So Mrs Smith realised there was a risk to her and did something brave to reduce this risk. Her risk of developing breast cancer is now reduced from almost 90% to around 10%.</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><i>We can all reduce our own individual risk of developing cancer; e.g., stop smoking, lose weight, eat more fruit and veg, drink less alcohol etc. </i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><i>But the crux is that whilst we can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reduce</span> our risk, we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot eliminate</span> it altogether. Mrs Smith still has a 10% chance of contracting breast cancer notwithstanding her surgery. </i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><i>However, Irish Life can help Mr &amp; Mrs Smith do something positive to protect her family if the unfortunate happens. In our view they both need cover – both life and illness cover - more than ever now. </i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><i>The good news is that they would be most likely acceptable risks (although Mrs Smith will probably have an exclusion for breast cancer). Most people would think that Mr &amp; Mrs Smith’s opportunity to get cover had passed – when actually they need it now more than ever. </i></p>
&#160;

In the last 7 years Irish life has paid out 590 specified illness claims for malignant breast cancer to a value of €38.9m. The youngest claimant was just 29 years old. And by the way, males can get breast cancer too - we've actually paid 5 claims to males for breast cancer in the last year or so.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Wow your post really hits home why everyone needs illness AND life insurance. Doesn't make sense to me why people don't get it. Must be a bad financial adviser, they've never been known for bad advice have they? Ha!

Great story, loved the post.  Keep it up!

<title>It&#039;s a Dad&#039;s Life, or is it?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"Some people ask what’s the secret to a good marriage?   Twice a week; we take time to go to a nice restaurant, candlelight, a little wine, soft music. She goes Tuesdays. I go Fridays." - Anon

&#160;</blockquote>
This Sunday is Father’s Day. Now on Mother’s Day I’m expected to have a nice card and maybe some chocolates or perfume on hand (which I pretend my children have bought). I’ve no problem with that – Mums are special.

However, Father’s Day seems to be a non-event in our house. I could be waiting long time for any sign of appreciation. To be honest I’d even settle for a pair of socks at this stage.  We did a survey of attitudes recently and it seems I’m not alone – only 1 in 3 Dads say their kids appreciate them, while less than half say their wives or partners appreciate them! In fact our research shows  found that Mums and Dads don’t see eye to eye on a lot of things!. For example -
<ul>
<li>• Dad says he spends an average of 55 hours a week on housework or childcare – Mum says it’s more like half that at 29 hours!</li>
<li></li>
<li>• Dad enjoys about 23 hours a week free time – about double what Mum gets.</li>
<li></li>
<li>• Dad thinks he spends 14 hours quality time a week with his partner, she thinks it’s just 10 hours (she doesn’t count watching sport!).</li>
</ul>
&#160;

&#160;

This might be a bit of fun but there’s an important financial point at the end of it. Dad’s may feel under-appreciated by their families, but this also means they underestimate the financial consequences to their families if they were not there.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[With Secondary schools already on their Summer break, and Primary schools about to close down for the Summer break, parents across the country are scratching their heads and counting the cents to plan and pay for that family holiday that will appeal to all siblings in the family.

There is no doubt about it, but Disneyland ticks all boxes on that front.  Everyone of us, young and old, have grown up with the Disney characters, so from the moment you enter the theme park, you are transported into a nostalgia filled journey of childhood memories.  If the memories are not enough for you, then the adrenaline rush from some of the most famous and exhilarating theme park rides like Space Mountain might make the holiday one to remember.

Well you might be wondering why I am here extolling the virtues of Disneyland Paris in this blog.  No, we are not branching out in to the travel agent industry, but we are giving one lucky person the chance to win a family holiday in Disneyland Paris, and it couldn't be easier.

You will find all you need to enter by clicking the link to the left.  Closing date is Friday 28th June, so time is running out.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>
“It takes considerable knowledge to realise the extent of your own ignorance”.</strong>

Thomas Sowell

&#160;
<ul>
<li>Markets started the week on a quiet but negative note with worse than forecast industrial data in the US at the end of the previous week and a small softening the University of Michigan consumer confidence survey concerning traders</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>In the UK, the Rightmove House Price index increased again in June bringing total gains for the year to +2.7%. Interestingly, the recovery in house prices outside of London and the Southeast is gathering pace with prices up 9.2% in the North of the country</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>In Ireland there was good news on the export front with the April volumes up 4% and stemming the sharp slowdown experienced in the second half of 2012</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>The US is also showing signs of a housing recovery with the home builders’ confidence survey hitting 52 in June (from 44 in May), a level last seen in 2006. The poor reading in May looks to have been a temporary phenomenon</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Inflation is on the move – US headline rates have gone from 1.1% to 1.4% and in the UK from 2.4% to 2.6%</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>The major market event this week was the indication from the Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, that their bond purchase programme (which has been supporting markets) will now be tapered off in 2013 and finish completely in 2014. Equity markets were surprised by this move and reacted negatively as a perceived support was removed. Bond markets also reacted negatively and yields moved higher. Bond investors interpreted the move as a signal that the underlying economy was perhaps stronger than previously thought</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Equity investors were also hit by a weak Chinese manufacturing survey number inflaming fears over the health of the economy. It fell to 48.3 indicating a decline in manufacturing</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Despite the turbulent week for markets, it ended on a higher note for Ireland. The EU Finance Ministers have agreed to allow the ESM to directly recapitalize banks directly. What does that mean? It means Europe may put up to €16bn into Irish banks in the long term</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li><b>The story of the week for me</b>…both amazes and horrifies me in equal measure. Nivea, the people who aim to protect you skin from the harmful rays of the sun, are running an ad campaign in Brazil showing a paper-thin solar panel with a USB plug that aims to recharge your phone without needing an electrical socket – even on a beach! This “talk’n’tan” strategy surely spells the end for the beach as one of the last sanctuaries of peace from the digital chatter in offices, buses, trains, planes and just about everywhere else. (Un)Fortunately, this device is unlikely to make it to Ireland. Something about needing sunshine to work….</li>

“Between two evils, I always pick the one I never tried before”.</strong>

Mae West

&#160;
<ul>
<li>Market continued to be weak on Monday post Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke paving the way for a reduction in the bond buying programme that has supported markets for some time now</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>US 10 year yields rose over 0.40% in a week to touch 2.6% and the dollar has strengthened to $1.31 against the Euro as investors move money into dollars as interest rates improve</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Ireland’s upcoming budget was the subject of much debate as the government consider their options around €1bn saved via the Anglo promissory note. Pressure will mount to give something back to the taxpayer although it would come at the expense of eliminating our budget deficit. European eyes will be watching</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Mortgage arrears here were also in focus as the number of owner occupiers in 90+ days arrears rose from 11.9% to 12.3%. That figure increases to 19.7% for the buy-to-let market</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Global markets are still unsure where the next leg of growth is coming from. What is becoming clear, however, is that the US recovery is fragile and China is not firing on all cylinders. Europe appears to be the beacon of light for the short term where economic indicators are still edging higher</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Commodity prices are still under pressure with copper, aluminium and nickel all hitting 52 week lows recently. Clearly, this is impacting on Emerging Markets performance</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Late in the week data on the Irish economy for H2 2012 emerged showing that although it was essentially flat, the falloff in export led growth was offset with a rise in domestic spending</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>However, GDP for Q1 has shown a weak start to 2013 and domestic demand will be key to maintaining at least flat performance year on year</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>House prices in Ireland look to have cooled again although volatile, down 0.8% in April. The market is still guessing what impact the legislation around repossessions may have on prices and liquidity in the market. In the UK, house prices continue their rally</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li><b>The story of the week for me</b>…is as scary as it is bizarre. Huggies, the nappy people, have aired an advert in which dads can now be a more integral part of pregnancy. They have developed a special “belly” belt prospective fathers can wear which simulates real time kicks and movements via sensors in a belt worn by mum. Huggies defended the product for dads saying “they’re pregnant too” and this was a way of “compensating” them. Before someone invents the “birthing belt”, perhaps men should draw the line at celebrating the birth with one too many drinks and their own take on morning sickness…</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>
“When I despair, I remember that all through history, the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants and murderers and, for a time, they seem invincible but in the end, they always fall. Always.”</strong>

Mahatma Gandhi

&#160;
<ul>
<li>Markets started the week on a positive note with the US ISM manufacturing survey increasing to 50.9, indicating a modest pick-up</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>UK mortgage approvals in May hit a high since 2009 implying a robust recovery in the housing market</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>At home, Irish exchequer returns for June were positive with better than expected revenues, and cuts in current and capital spending. This left us about €800m better off (0.5% GDP) and makes our year-end target of a 7.4% deficit look very comfortable</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Further good news was contained in the Irish PMI (purchasing managers’ index) which rose to 54.9 in June up from 52.7 in May, with service companies adding jobs at the fastest pace since January. Crucially this survey has tended to be a good lead indicator</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Portuguese political instability caused markets to wobble midweek when it was announced that the government had lost the leader of its junior coalition partner. This caused the yields on their sovereign bonds to temporarily hit 8%</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Irish unemployment fell again in June, from 13.7% in May to 13.6%, which seasonally adjusted is the lowest rate since August 2009. Interestingly, it was not only emigration and employment growth helping the numbers but a reduction in the number of new claims also</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>The week finished on a very positive note for equities with unexpected guidance from the Bank of England and the ECB that interest rates would remain low. The Euro Stoxx 50 was up 2.8% on the day. Bonds markets were largely unchanged on the news</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li><b>The story of the week for me</b>…should start with “play it again Sam”. The most famous grand piano maker in the world has agreed to be bought by the private equity firm Kohlberg &amp; Co for a whopping $438m in cash. The 160 year old company, who were founded in a loft on Manhattan’s lower west side, sell their grand pianos for up to $218,000 each. They also make saxophones, clarinets and trombones amongst other instruments but have made their name in grand pianos and are a firm favourite with the concert pianists. The deal appears to be part of a move back into luxury goods by private equity firms looking to capitalise on the recovering finances of the well to do. Needless to say when it comes to all things luxury, China has been the fastest growing market for the company since 2005.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>
“If the facts don’t fit the theory, change the facts.”</strong>

Albert Einstein

&#160;
<ul>
<li>Markets have been volatile of late with strong gains on one day being offset by losses the next. Most recently, strong gains driven by optimistic sounds from the Bank of England and the ECB around maintaining low interest rates going forward were knocked on the head by the US Fed reinforcing the markets view they would initiate the withdrawal of the monthly asset purchases from September</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>The Euro Stoxx 50 started the week well up 2.1% on Monday driven by increased optimism around growth prospects and the euro also gained against the dollar</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Ireland are to start discussions with the Troika about exiting the bailout programme, however, it would still require a potential emergency line of credit for the banks particularly with a banks stress test scheduled for 2014</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>The UK industrial production data for May was disappointing for April and May but encouragingly it has not prevented the IMF from revising up its forecast for UK growth form 0.3% in 2013 to 0.9%. Every little helps…</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>The UK housing market is proving resilient with the RICS survey at a 3 year high</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>The dollar weakened against the Euro significantly late in the week with a statement from Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, that monetary policy would remain accommodative for the foreseeable future. The rate touched off $1.32 on the day. Stock markets however responded very well to the news</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>News flow around Irish consumer spending has been weak of late, however, the most recent measure of Consumer Confidence has hit its highest point since 2007. Lower inflation has helped, driven by a fall in energy and mortgage costs</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Car sales in Ireland around the new 132 plate have proven interesting with more cars sold in the first week of July this year (4,675) than the entire month of July last year (4,424)</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li><b>The story of the week for me</b>…is a dirty one, but not what you might be thinking. In fact this is the kind of dirt that could kill you prematurely. Specifically we are talking about smog and the 5.5 years it could cut form your life expectancy if you live in certain parts of China. In the north of the country the high levels of smog experienced cause increased lung cancer, heart attacks and strokes. It is a regular occurrence to see a run on air filters in your local shop when the air quality takes a dip. The really scary statistic in all of this featured in a report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who calculated that air pollution caused the loss of 2.5 billion years of life expectancy in the 1990’s alone.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>“To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all of life’s problems.”</strong>

Homer Simpson

&#160;
<ul>
<li>Markets in Europe are back in focus for international investors with news that the opposition socialist party in Portugal are demanding a renegotiation of the terms of their bailout programme. Their 10 yr sovereign bond yields continue to range between 7-7.5% as a result</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Ireland was the beneficiary of some good news from the rating agencies with S&amp;P ugrading the outlook on Irish debt from “stable” to “positive”. In stark contrast, Moody’s continue to rate Irish debt as sub-investment grade and with a negative outlook. However, they did issue a note last weekend suggesting that sustained economic growth would cause them to review their rating with an upward bias</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Chinese GDP for Q2 was released early in the week and was +7.5% on 2012. Although in line with market expectations, it provided a boost to market sentiment</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>US retail sales, although up 0.4% for June, were below expectations. Consumer sentiment has dipped recently although still remains above the 2007 highs.</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>US inflation also fell modestly to 1.6%. The Federal Reserve will be watching that very carefully to avoid any further signs of weakness. They would like to see some inflation in the system to signal underlying strength in the economy</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>UK inflation is running at closer to 3%, above their 2% target but not an immediate cause for concern with other pricing indicators showing signs of weakness</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>The week ended positively for markets with the Euro Stoxx 50 up 1.4% and the S&amp;P up 0.5% driven by better than expected US unemployment numbers. They were the lowest since May at 334,000</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>In Europe, sentiment received a welcome boost when the Spanish government held a successful debt auction raising over €3bn</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li><b>The story of the week for me</b>…is an educational one. Literally. The US based accreditation body, AACSB, have published their findings for 2013 on graduate and undergraduate education, which makes for some interesting reading. It seems the US have 9,799 business degree programmes. There are only 1,786 in Europe. In 2012, over 156,000 students enrolled on an MBA programme in the US. The number for the rest of the world combined was only 110,000! Maybe that is because 493 ‘schools’ in the US offer the MBA. Outside of the US there are only 194 ‘schools’ offering the same programme. So in a world where who you know can sometimes be just as important as what you know….if you have an MBA, the chances are you got it in the US.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>
“There is no sin except stupidity.”</strong>

Oscar Wilde

&#160;
<ul>
<li>Markets had a soft start to the week on the back of poorer than expected results in the technology sector in the US led by global giants Microsoft and Google</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>That was followed by poorer than expected US existing home sales figures. The S&amp;P 500 still managed to finish up on the day which may indicate that investors think the weak housing numbers could delay the Federal Reserve reducing its support for the economy. Later in the week however, new home sales hit a 5 year high and the S&amp;P 500 fell.</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>The Japanese government upgraded their growth forecasts early last week which help lift the major Asian markets. Their stock market is up over 30% year to date already in local currency</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Closer to home, in more ways than one, Ireland witnessed its first annual rise in property prices since 2008. Dublin is leading the way with prices up 4.2% year on year, while the rest of the country is actually down 1%, a function of the oversupply that still exists outside the capital. Anecdotally, even within Dublin the market it is very localised and reduced supply in some areas has caused prices to rise over 10% in the same period. With house building at subdued levels, it is difficult to see this situation abating in the short term. Legislation around repossessions may offer increased liquidity in the Dublin market later in the year</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>The Purchasing Managers Index for Europe provided a 1.4% midweek boost to the Euro Stoxx 50. The index rose to 50.4 in July (over 50 indicating expansion), the first such reading since early 2012</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Housing stats in the UK continue to impress with monthly construction data suggesting output bounced back in Q2. April was up 4.6% on the previous year and May was flat. UK GDP growth is likely to be driven by the domestic economy in the short term and turning around one of the weakest sectors in the last few years will go a long way towards achieving that</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>The week ended on a positive note for Europe with a rise in the German IFO business sentiment survey</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li><b>The story of the week for me</b>…was about football. At the end of a league season in football each team adds up the points awarded for winning or drawing games. Where two teams have equal points, the winner is chosen based on goal difference - the total number of goals you scored minus the number of goals scored against you. Whoever has the largest goal difference wins. Such a situation occurred recently in Nigeria and raised eyebrows when Plateau United Feeders beat Arkurba 79-0 in the last game of the season, while the other team sharing top spot, Police Machine, beat their opponents Bubayaro 67-0. Clearly, both teams were trying to get their goal difference as high as possible. Needless to say, the players and officials from all four teams involved have been banned for life. For the record, the top scorer for Police Machine scored 11 goals…his best game all season!!</li>

<title>Is SEPA the New Y2K?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pc.jpg" target="_blank"><img class=" wp-image-2265 alignleft" style="padding: 0 5px 5px 0;" alt="SEPA" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pc.jpg" width="210" height="210" /></a><strong>The General Gist:</strong>
You may have heard the acronyms SEPA, BIC or IBAN recently. Have you wondered what they meant but quickly forgotten about them? If so, then you wouldn’t be alone.

SEPA is the Single Euro Payments Area which comprises a total of 32 countries (so far). Its aim is to standardise Euro payments across Europe for businesses and consumers. This comes into full effect from February 1st 2014.

<strong>The main things you’ll need to know about are BIC and IBAN numbers:</strong>
Business Identifier Code (BIC): a unique identification code for both financial and non-financial institutions. It’s kind of like your bank sort code but it specifies a particular business, country and region all within the one BIC.

International Bank Account Number (IBAN): an international means of identifying bank accounts across national borders. This is what you’ll use instead of your bank account number from February onwards. The format of these is different for every country but for Ireland this one IBAN will contain your country code, sort code and bank account number.

Are you with me so far? The concept isn’t too daunting once you know the basics. However, now you may be thinking that you can simply ignore SEPA and go about your daily routine. I’m afraid not! SEPA is a mandatory EU Regulation so all businesses will have to conform to SEPA by the 1st February 2014. Bank account numbers and sort codes will be a thing of the past and replaced with IBAN and BIC for all businesses in Europe.

<strong>Now for the Hard Part:</strong>
Irish Life has been around for a long time (1939 to be exact), so you can imagine that bank accounts and sort codes have been part of our business processes for eons. With the introduction of SEPA we now have to convert all of our systems and processes to be in line with European regulations. It’s similar to Y2K in the sense that organisations Europe wide need to check and upgrade heavily integrated features of their IT systems before a fixed date. No small task!

I’m currently working as a lead IT developer on the SEPA project and as a result I get to delve into the bowels of the business like never before. It is challenging work but the change will enable businesses and consumers to make payments to 32 countries and will in turn facilitate trade and strengthen European competitiveness.

To quote Martin Luther King Jr.,
<blockquote> Our very survival depends on our ability to stay awake, to adjust to new ideas, to remain vigilant and to face the challenge of change.</blockquote>
For more information about SEPA visit: <a title="http://www.readyforsepa.ie/" href="http://www.readyforsepa.ie/" target="_blank">http://www.readyforsepa.ie/</a> and check back over the next while for more updates on how changes to our systems for SEPA impact our business.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks Darragh for this well explained post.
Absolutely SEPA is going to rule the payment structure of European countries. As the deadline date for switching to SEPA is very close all the bank and financial services provider are busy to complete all the formats required for SEPA Migration. Even there are few bank say for example ING who have already completed the SEPA transition and working on that and most of the companies are done with their SEPA planning.]]></wp:comment_content>

<title>Unravelling the Mystery of IBAN</title>
<link>http://blog.irishlife.ie/general/unravelling-the-mystery-of-iban/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/symbols/images/flag_yellow_low.jpg" width="186" height="127" /><strong>The Basic Stuff:</strong>

The International Bank Account Number (IBAN) is an internationally agreed means of identifying bank accounts across national borders. From February 1st 2014 this will replace bank account numbers and sort codes in Ireland.
Not all countries use the same format for the number. However, they all have some common features.

<strong>Irish IBANs:</strong>
What’s in an IBAN? Banks in this country provide you with an IBAN made up of 22 letters &amp; numbers. The structure is shown below (for Ireland only).

<strong><em> IEdd aaaa bbbb bbcc cccc cc</em></strong>
• <strong>IE</strong> is the country code for Ireland
• <strong>dd</strong> is the check digit for validation
• <strong>aaaa</strong> is the bank code
• <strong>bbbbbb</strong> is the sort code
• <strong>cccccccc</strong> is the account number

All IBANs begin with a country code, so the very first thing you can do is assess what nation it’s referencing. The check digit is calculated using a specific mathematical computation which you won’t need to worry about doing yourself. Bank codes are letters which specify an organisation (e.g. Bank of Ireland would be BOFI). Sort codes and account numbers remain the same as they currently are.

So if your account is (1) in Ireland, (2) with AIB, (3) has a sort code of 01-02-03 and (4) an account number of 12345678, the result would be as below.
IE23 AIBK 0102 0312 3456 78

Simple as that!

<strong>Now for the Hard Part:</strong>
Irish Life is Ireland's leading life, investment and pension company so we are well used to dealing with accounts based in Irish banks. However, with the introduction of IBAN we have to be able to accept payments from any bank within the 32 SEPA countries around Europe. Given that not all countries use the same IBAN format this can be a tricky business but at the same time it opens up payment options to a whole new international level.

Irish Life as a company are committing to enhancements which contribute to an overall European effort. Why is this change good for the consumer? Well, you’ll be able set up payments with us just like any other company in the SEPA region. 32 countries, 1 IBAN, easy!

To quote Vince Lombardi;
<blockquote>Individual commitment to a group effort—that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Canadian Bill Kyle loves sport and has wasted no time in immersing himself in Gaelic games since landing here on July 1st to take over as Irish Life chief executive.

He was at the Dublin-Cork hurling semi-final and the Dublin-Kerry football equivalent, both lauded as classic matches. It might explain the Dublin jersey with Kyle’s name printed on the back hanging on its lonesome from a coat rack in his generously proportioned corner office on the ninth floor of the Irish Life building on Abbey Street.  And the hurley and sliotar in Cork and Clare colours respectively, draped across one on the window sills.  “They were just unbelievable matches,” he says in a discernible north American accent.

“You can never cross the ocean unless you have the courage to lose sight of the shore.”</strong>

Christopher Columbus

&#160;
<ul>
<li>Ireland got off to a strong start to the short week with exchequer returns for July indicating government finances are in good shape and still on track to beat its deficit target. Tax revenues are marginally ahead year to date, driven in large part by the +12.6% increase in Corporation tax. Government expenditure is also slightly better than expected. While the spending budget was reduced by 1.8%, the actual amount spent was 15.9% below target. This means we could beat our 7.4% GDP deficit by around 0.5% this year</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>The US had a quiet start to the week despite the strong services sector surveys. The non-manufacturing ISM rose to 56 in July from 52.2 in June. A number greater than 50 indicates expansion within the sector</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>In the bigger picture, the US and Eurozone have been instrumental in driving the Global Purchasing Managers Index to 54.1 in July, its highest level since March 2012 and indicative of the further strengthening of the world economy over the summer months</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Irish consumer confidence figures were released at the back end of the week and, although</li>
</ul>
they fell a little in July, they are still close to the highest readings since 2008.

&#160;
<ul>
<li>Irish car sales reported for July were very strong with 11,500 cars sold, compared to only 4,432 sold this time last year</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Irish CPI inflation was 0.7% in July, unchanged from June. However, this number largely reflects external pricing. If you strip out energy and mortgage interest, CPI inflation was 1.1% in July. Indeed, looking only at Services price inflation the number excluding mortgage interest is closer to 2.3%</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Chinese export numbers at the end of the week were up strongly at +5.1% in the year t the end of July. This coincided with the release of Chinese industrial production numbers which showed a 9.7% increase year to date, up from +8.9% in June</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li><b>The story of the week for me</b>…is as scary as it is interesting. Sergey Brin, the billionaire founder of Google, has emerged as the investor behind a bizarre project – laboratory grown beef. The first public tasting of a “burger” took place in London yesterday. The investment by Brin enabled scientists to produce enough lab-grown fibres to make three 140g (5oz) burgers, with each containing 20,000 muscle fibres grown in special chambers. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation estimate that demand for meat will grow 73% by 2050 and demand will be environmentally unsustainable due to shortages of land to feed the extra livestock (not to mention the subsequent greenhouse emissions!) Despite the fact that it apparently tasted “meaty but rather dry”, nobody seems to have picked on the fact that these burgers cost €233,333.33 each. One problem solved, one to go…</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>
“Bart, with $10,000 we’d be millionaires! We could buy all sorts of useful things…like love!”</strong>

Homer Simpson

&#160;
<ul>
<li>The week got off to a quiet start with much of the positive momentum around the Chinese economy being offset by continued speculation around when the Fed will start to reduce the $85bn it currently spends every month buying back bonds</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>US treasury yields have traded up in recent weeks on the back of this speculation and currently trade at over 2.8%</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>UK house prices are officially expanding at a faster rate than any time since November 2006 with all regions in the UK benefitting from the increase in pricing</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Technology companies were to the fore in the US with Apple recording a particularly strong day (+4.75%) after Carl Icahn disclosed on Twitter that his company had a “large position” in the company. Mixed fortunes for Blackberry though, as the company recently put itself up for sale but has found there to be little interest at this stage</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>US banks are starting to show some confidence in Europe as lending to selective Eurozone banks from their US counterparts picks up</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Euro area GDP growth was positive at +0.3% for Q2 2013</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Irish trade data for June was also positive with goods export volumes up 2.3% in Q2 after a sharp fall of 4.9% in Q1. This fall was largely driven by the difficulties in the pharma sector early in the year but this data suggests the worst may be behind us</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>At the back end of the week we got confirmation that US inflation is now running at 2%, which may further incline the Fed to cut back on its spending given the continued fall in the jobless claims at the same time</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>UK 10 year government bond yields are following the same path as the US with sellers forcing prices down and yields up to 2.7%, with similar effects in Germany where the yield is now 1.9%</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li><b>The story of the week for me</b>…was about jobs. Not just any old jobs, dream jobs. There are not many people who can claim to have theirs but Hannah Fraser certainly does. From the age of nine, she got her first taste of what it would be to be a mermaid when her mother helped her design a costume. Having tasted some success as a photographer and a brief modelling career, she became a full time professional mermaid! Her work includes underwater modelling and performance art. She recently launched a range of diving watches for Omega at an event in Capri and now lives in Hollywood. Living the dream..</li>
</ul>

“Weather forecast for tonight: dark...”</strong>

<i>George Carlin</i>

&#160;
<ul>
<li>The US FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) released their monthly minutes confirming that the Fed will begin to taper QE (Quantitative Easing) before the end of this year, possibly as soon as the end of Q3. The FOMC also expressed that they expect this exercise to finish by the middle of next year.</li>
</ul>
&#160;

&#160;
<ul>
<li>Emerging market assets were hit hard due to the market’s reaction towards the FOMC minutes which resulted in increased expectations that global liquidity will diminish as the US Federal Reserve withdraws stimulus from the economy.</li>
</ul>
&#160;

&#160;
<ul>
<li>Japanese exports slipped for the first time in eight months in July, as subdued demand in key markets such as the US and Asia offset the boost to manufactures from a falling Yen.</li>
</ul>
&#160;

&#160;
<ul>
<li>Irish property prices were released for July – prices in Dublin were up 3.3% on the month and 8.8% YoY (Year-on-Year), the single largest monthly rise since 2005. The trend in Dublin is one of growth, underpinned by a shortage of supply. Outside the capital, prices fell 0.1% on the month and 1.5% Year on Year.</li>
</ul>
&#160;

&#160;
<ul>
<li>Figures published by the CSO highlight how austerity has impacted consumer spending, with expenditure on goods and services falling by 12% since 2008. An analysis of the CPI (Consumer Price Index) shows health insurance has more than doubled, while the cost of education has jumped by 30%, public transport by 29%, electricity by 31%, and gas by 27%. Total expenditure on food, drink, and tobacco has fallen by 5%, while money spent on mortgage interest and rents has fallen by 11%.</li>
</ul>
&#160;

&#160;
<ul>
<li>The Eurozone’s recovery eked out further gains in august as the Composite Markit Purchasing Managers’ Index, combining both manufacturing and services sector, rose to 51.7 in a “flash” or preliminary reading for August from 50.5 in July – its highest level in two years. (Any reading above 50 indicates overall growth). New manufacturing orders, particularly in Germany, drove this expansion.</li>
</ul>
&#160;

&#160;
<ul>
<li><b>The story of the week for me</b>….involves the Norwegian Prime Minister pretending to be a taxi driver demonstrating his charm to voters, which ultimately backfired when it transpired that passengers were paid for the ride and most cut the journey short due to his bad driving!</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>
“One person with a belief is equal to a force of ninety-nine with only interest”</strong>

<i>John Stuart Mill</i>

&#160;
<ul>
<li>Speculation that Greece may need a further debt write-down as well as a third, smaller bailout package was fuelled by comments from the Greek Finance Minister last weekend. But with the domino effect of the last haircut fresh in investors’ minds, it remains an unlikely probability in the short term. Nevertheless, the budgetary arithmetic for 2014 still points to a €11bn shortfall which may need to be plugged by a third, smaller bailout.</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Orders for US durable goods were released this week, recording their biggest drop in almost a year in July (-7.3% vs. expected 4%). While the sharp fall in orders in the volatile aircraft sector was expected, the core orders series (ex-aircraft) also declined 0.6% over the month versus an expected 0.5% rise.</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>The CSO reported for the year to the end of June that the number of people in employment has risen by 33,800. Figures released show a 1.8% increase in the numbers in work, which now stands at 1,869,900. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate now stands at 13.7%. The CSO figures also suggest that public sector pay has risen by 1.3% over the 12 months to the end of June, at a higher rate than wages in the private sector.</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>The Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, gave his maiden speech striking a typically dovish tone (promoting monetary policies that involve the maintenance of low interest rates). Carney spoke of labour productivity in the economy which must increase to catch up with trend growth, meaning a more gradual improvement in unemployment and consequently a lower bank rate.</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Irish emigration statistics continue to rise. At one stage there was a person leaving the country every six minutes, which is the highest number since records began back in the 1980’s. What is particularly striking is that more than a third of the people leaving to set up a new life abroad are between the ages of 15 and 24.</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>In company news it has emerged that Steve Ballmer, the CEO of Microsoft, is to step down after spending 30 years in the company, much of which was spent beside his friend and former CEO, Bill Gates.</li>
</ul>
&#160;

&#160;
<ul>
<li><b>The story of the week for me</b>….comes from the Edinburgh Fringe festival. They run a competition for the funniest one liner, which this year was won by the English comedian Rob Auton for his one-liner - "I heard a rumour that Cadbury is bringing out an oriental chocolate bar. Could be a Chinese Wispa."</li>

“Without a struggle, there can be no progress”</strong>

<i>Frederick Douglas </i>

&#160;
<ul>
<li>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) released their latest Interim Economic Assessment noting a moderate recovery is underway in the major advanced economies. The report outlined that the euro area as a whole is technically out of recession and economic growth in the major advanced economies is expected to continue at a similar pace in the second half of 2013.</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>The European Central Bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged following data suggesting that the economy in the single currency area is recovering.</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>The Eurozone Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index) rose to reach its highest level since June 2011 posting a reading of 51.3 (a reading above 50 is indicative of expansion and a reading below 50 is indicative of contraction). The PMI has now signalled expansion for two consecutive months.</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>UK survey data this week indicated that the UK Manufacturing and Services sectors maintained a robust start to the third quarter of 2013 with growth rates for both variables at their highest since 1994. The seasonally adjusted Markit Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) hit a two-and-a-half year high of 57.2 in August. The PMI has now signalled expansion for five successive months.</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>US employers added 169,000 jobs in August. In its monthly employment report, the Bureau of Labour Statistics lowered the combined total for job gains in June and July by 74,000. This suggests that the labour-market recovery is weaker than first thought and could defer the Federal Reserve's plans to reduce its monthly bond-buying programme.</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>Irish exchequer returns released over the week showed a slippage in tax receipts against government targets. The most puzzling aspect was a 0.6% shortfall in income tax, despite the 1.8% rise in employment in the year to Q2. Nevertheless, the government remains on course to hit this year's deficit target.</li>
</ul>
&#160;
<ul>
<li>The story of the week for me…. Was about the latest addition to the skyline of London, a glass clad 37-storey tower dubbed the “Walkie Talkie,” which was blamed last week for melting parts of a car parked on the street below. The building reflects the sun’s rays with such intensity that you can even fry an egg standing in a specific location in the street below the building.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong> "Continuous effort not strength or intelligence is the key to unlocking potential." </strong>

Winston Churchill

&#160;

France, the Eurozone's second biggest economy, cut its 2014 growth forecast and confirmed that it will overshoot budget deficit targets this year. France hasn't posted a budget surplus in any year since 1974, while it has had a trade deficit every year since 2002.

&#160;

Irish CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation fell to a three-year low of 0.2% in August. This primarily reflects lower energy prices and mortgage interest costs. Excluding these items, CPI inflation was 0.7% in August. Services price inflation (ex-mortgage interest) was 2.3%, indicative of a gradually reflating economy and the return of positive wage growth in 2012 and 2013.

&#160;

Although growth outlook is mixed across Emerging Markets in Asia, the latest Asian Business Cycle Indicators (ABCIs) suggest signs of growth stabilisation for China and a more positive outlook for the Philippines and Singapore. The key downside risk facing Southeast Asia, China and India is the prospect of the tapering of quantitative easing (QE) policy in the US.

&#160;

China's exports rose in August while inflation remained subdued, exports are up 7.2% yoy (year on year) in August. Imports also rose last month, gaining 7%. Total foreign trade grew 7.1% in August over the same month in 2012. The trade surplus widened by 8.4% yoy to 28.52bn last month, the highest since January this year.

&#160;

Consumer Confidence in the U.S. declined to the lowest level since April, indicating household spending may take time to pick up. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment has fallen to 76.8 this month from August’s 82.1.

&#160;

According to the Office for National Statistics the United States unemployment rate fell to 7.7 % in the three months through July from 7.8 % in the second quarter (Q2).

&#160;

The story of the week for me…. Was an article outlining Greece's next wave of austerity driven reforms, which are aimed at improving the civil service. Public sector workers will no longer enjoy a privilege they have had for more than two decades - six extra days of paid holiday every year if they use a computer at work.

“A two year old is kind of like having a blender, but you don’t have the top for it.”</strong>

Jerry Seinfeld

&#160;

Ireland started the week on a good note with news that the mortgage approvals were up 7.3% on June 2012, while loans for new house purchases were up 8.8%

&#160;

House prices in the UK continue to rise with the Nationwide survey indicating a rise of 0.8% in the month of July. This is the sixth straight month of house price rises indicating the success of their Help-to-Buy scheme in turn sentiment in the sector around

&#160;

A recent report on the Irish mortgage market pointed out that arrears are high and set to rise, with 90+ day mortgage arrears already at some commentators’ expected peak levels of c.16% by value. Even though employment rose over 1.1% from March 2012 to March 2013, it has been unable to prevent these further increases. This points to a rise in strategic non-payment of mortgages by people who believe their houses can’t be taken from them or perhaps, that if they refuse to pay, they will benefit from some form of debt write down. The upcoming repossession legislation may challenge those assumptions

&#160;

Over 1,900 cars were sold on the 1<sup>st</sup> July in Ireland with the new ‘132’ plate

&#160;

Irish Manufacturing PMI (purchasing managers’ survey) rose to 51 in July from 50.3 the previous month. A number over 50 indicates the sector is growing. This follows on from the European Manufacturing PMI which also expanded in July, the first such expansion since mid-2011.

&#160;

US GDP growth came in slightly better than the 1% expected briefly pushing 10 year Treasuries above 2.7% as markets typically rotate out of bonds and into equities in anticipation of growth

&#160;

No further change in rates came from the EBC or the Bank of England late in the week but markets will be watching closely for any change in language going forward that might shed some light on Mario Draghi’s comment that rates would stay low for an “extended” period

&#160;

Following the strong Irish and European manufacturing surveys early in the week came a sharp increase in the US survey (from 50.9 to 55.4) and the Chinese survey (to break through the critical 50 level). Equity markets reacted very positively to this on both sides of the Atlantic with Euro Stoxx 50 up 1.5% and S&amp;P 500 up 1.3% on the day

&#160;

<b>The story of the week for me</b>…goes back to World War II. It has recently emerged that the Bank of England helped to sell gold looted from the National Bank of Czechoslovakia by the Nazi’s after the invasion in 1939. In today’s money, over €736m was “transferred” to the Reichsbank account in the Bank for International Settlements, the so-called central banks’ bank. Perhaps money is the root of all evil…?

<title>Sizing up SEPA DD Mandates</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Irish Life is Ireland's leading life, investment and pension company, so naturally we deal with many direct debits. Here is a brief overview of the new Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) Direct Debit Mandates which will come into effect from February 2014.

<strong><b>The Basic Stuff<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sepa.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2443 alignright" alt="sepa" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sepa.jpg" width="245" height="245" /></a></b></strong>

You’ve probably heard of SEPA, IBANs, BICs, etc. and they’ve hopefully become a familiar concept by now. But what’s this other idea of SEPA direct debit mandates all about?

The basic concept: A company requests money from a customer, with their prior approval, and credits it to themselves.

<strong><b>What Does This Mean?</b></strong>

The SDD mandate allows a biller to collect funds from a payer's account, provided that a signed mandate has been granted by the payer to the biller. The mandate is signed by the payer to authorise the biller to collect a payment and to instruct the payer's bank to pay the agreed collections.

The mandate can be issued in paper or electronic formats (e-mandates). Each one will have unique mandate reference (UMR) which will be assigned by the biller.

For example, if a new customer signs up for a protection plan with Irish Life that requires monthly direct debits, they will sign a mandate form. This mandate allows us to collect the DD payment every month from the customer’s bank account. The UMR will be generated by Irish Life and communicated to the customer.

Are you with me so far?

<strong><b>Now for the Hard Part</b></strong>

SEPA comes into full effect on 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014. We’ll need to be ready to handle these new SEPA Direct Debits (SDDs) since all existing national systems will close on this date.

As Ireland's leading life, investment and pension company, we deal with a lot of direct debits. Introducing SEPA DD mandates, generating UMRs and the general administration of these concepts is a large task for any organisation. However, it’s one that should benefit the consumer under SEPA legislation. Once upgrades are in place for SEPA, it will be possible to exchange Euro payments between any accounts within the payments area as easily as it is within national borders today.

As Sumner Redstone (majority owner of CBS and Viacom) once said, “<em>We need to listen to consumers’ needs.</em>”]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>
"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm” </b>

Winston Churchill

&#160;

It was a short week in Ireland and the UK with a bank holiday on Monday and mid-term breaks meant markets were quieter than usual

&#160;

UK GDP numbers released at the end of the previous week showed the economy expanded by 0.8% in Q3, driven largely by the services sector, with a turnaround evident in the fortunes of construction and manufacturing, which had been drags on performance in recent months

&#160;

Irish retail sales are showing signs of recovery also, which although influenced by the 132 car registration series, also show some resilience on an underlying basis

&#160;

Irish property prices are back in the news with a rise of 1.8% in September alone and up 3.6% on the year. Dublin leads the way with a frothy 12.3% rise since this time last year, while property outside the capital is still falling and down 2.6%. Interestingly, the latest mortgage approval numbers are largely unchanged implying cash purchases still make up over 50% of transactions rather than first time buyers. Although a welcome relief for some, the rise in prices appears to be relevant to very specific parts of the market and driven by supply rather than underlying demand at this stage

&#160;

More good news on the domestic employment numbers late in the week with the live register below 400,000 for the first time since May 2009

&#160;

Finally on the home front, there were manufacturing numbers out on Friday which, at 54.9, indicated the 5th month in a row of growth above the 50 (no change) level. This is the strongest reading in over 2 years

&#160;

The EU Commission issued the results of a survey measuring Irish consumer confidence which pointed to a strong recovery. In fact, they were the highest recorded numbers since February 2006

&#160;

The Story of the week for me… Monday morning giving you a headache? Perhaps you should spare a thought for Eduardo Leite, a construction worker from Rio. While working on a site, a 6ft long iron bar fell from the 5th floor of the building he was working on, pierced his hand hard and went through his head narrowly missing his brain and came out just below his left eye brow. The surgeon elected to pull the rest of the bar through his head in the same direction it entered. After the surgery was complete Eduardo appeared perfectly lucid with no signs of negative consequences. Brings a whole new meaning to the phrase splitting headache.

<b>“Failure is the opportunity to begin again, more intelligently.”</b>

- Henry Ford

The OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) cut half a percentage point off its forecasts for global growth this year and next, attributing the revisions to a slowdown in emerging markets, political gridlock in Washington DC and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s tapering of bond purchases for the downgrade. The forecast expects the global economy will grow 2.7% this year and 3.6% in 2014, compared with estimates of 3.1% and 4%, made in May.

&#160;

Irish social protection as ratio of economic output was the highest in EU in 2011. Social protection which includes gross public welfare and health spending, for Ireland when measured in relation to GNP (gross national product, which mainly excludes the profits of the foreign-owned sector) amounted to 37% compared with an average of 29.7% of GDP for the EU28 and in Denmark (34.3%), France (33.6%), the Netherlands (32.3%), Belgium (30.4%), Greece (30.2%) and Finland (30.0%), and below 20% in Latvia (15.1%), Estonia (16.1%), Romania (16.3%), Lithuania (17.0%), Bulgaria (17.7%), Slovakia (18.2%), Malta (18.9%) and Poland (19.2%).

&#160;

New data on population trends show that in the 28-member country European Union growth was up over 1m last year (2012), with immigrants being responsible for most of the rise.

&#160;

Total health spending per capita fell in 11 of 33 OECD countries between 2009 and 2011, notably by 11.1% in Greece and 6.6% in Ireland.

&#160;

The latest EBS DKM Affordability Index shows that the national affordability level for first time buyers remains stable at 17.3% of net income for a working couple purchasing the average property, with this figure forecasted to rise to 17.7% by the end of this year.

&#160;

A survey of venture capital per capita suggests that Ireland is Europe's most entrepreneurial country.

&#160;

German business confidence rose to the highest level in more than 18 months in November, signalling the recovery in Europe’s largest economy remains on track even though growth slowed in the third quarter (Q3).

&#160;

Eurozone PMI signals slowing growth for a second successive month in November. At 51.5, down from 51.9 in October, the flash estimate of the Markit Eurozone PMI (purchasing managers' index) Composite Output Index remained above the 50.0 ‘no-change level’ for a fifth successive month in November, but signalled a slowing in growth for the second month running.

&#160;

The Federal Reserve vice Chair Janet Yellen moved closer on Thursday to becoming the first woman to lead the U.S. central bank after a Senate committee backed her nomination and the chamber changed its rules to make it easier for nominees to be confirmed.

&#160;

The story of the week for me… A volcanic eruption has given rise to a new island in the Pacific

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>
“The value of an idea lies in the using of it."</strong>

<i>– Thomas Edison</i>

&#160;

The U.S. Federal Reserve surprised markets by keeping its asset purchases steady at $85bn a month while cutting its growth forecast to within a range of 2.0% to 2.3%. Earlier forecasts had predicted growth of 2.3% to 2.6%.

&#160;

U.S. New-home construction picked up in August, indicating continued growth for the sector despite recent signs of softening demand. Housing starts rose 0.9% from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 891,000.

&#160;

U.S. Consumer price inflation edged down to 0.1% month-on-month in August from 0.2% reported in July, year-on-year (yoy) consumer prices are up 2%.

&#160;

Irish GDP rose 0.4% quarter-on-quarter (qoq) in Q2 2013 after a 0.6% decline in Q1 2013. GDP is down 1.2% year-on-year (yoy). The rebound in Q2 was driven by consumer spending (+0.7%) and exports (+4.5%). GDP is still down 1.2% in the year to Q2 2013.

&#160;

The Italian government revised its GDP forecast to -1.7% for 2013 compared with a previous projection of -1.3% made in April. For 2014, growth is now seen at 1.0%, down from 1.3% previously.

&#160;

A surge in Germany’s ZEW economic sentiment indicator signalled expectations of improved growth in the second half of 2013. The sentiment indicator has risen to 49.6 (the long term average is 23.84).

&#160;

UK House prices are up 3.3% year-on-year (yoy) in July from 3.1% in June. The year-on-year increase reflected growth of 3.7% in England and 1.8% in Northern Ireland, offset by falls of 2.0% in Scotland and 0.7% in Wales. The UK House Price Index (HPI) is still below its peak in January 2008. However, the English HPI at 182.4 in July 2013 is now 0.9% higher than at the previous peak in January 2008.

&#160;

The story of the week for me…. It’s one thing for one person to be caught short when it comes to toilet paper, but for a whole nation it's a rather more serious affair. Last week Venezuela ordered its National Guard to take control of a toilet paper factory to avoid scarcity of the product, in what it called “an effort to ensure consistent supplies.” Such shortages of consumer goods is beginning to become a common theme in Venezuela, as a result of the inability to import enough raw materials and machinery into the country, due to a shortage of hard currency as a result of the exchange controls imposed by the socialist government.

<strong>"We are not creatures of circumstance; we are creators of circumstance."</strong>

<i>- Benjamin Disraeli </i>

&#160;

China's economy signalled strength in September as a flash index of manufacturing activity rose to a-six month high. The preliminary HSBC China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rose to 51.2 in September compared with a final reading of 50.1 in August (a reading above 50 indicates expansion and one below 50 indicates contraction).

&#160;

Japan's consumer prices are up 0.8% in August from a year earlier on higher gasoline and other energy prices, posting the highest margin of increase since November 2008.

&#160;

U.S. household spending rose in August by 0.3% as incomes were buoyed by solid wage gains.

&#160;

U.S. new home sales rose by 7.9% in August, to 421,000. The out-turn for U.S. new home sales was broadly in line with expectations, easing concerns that the U.S. housing market is beginning to soften.

&#160;

A flash estimate of the Markit Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index (a key benchmark indicator for measuring businesses and economic conditions) rose to a 27-month high in September, signalling the largest rise in activity since June 2011. The flash PMI posted gains for the sixth consecutive month; up from 51.5 in August to 52.1(a reading above 50 indicates expansion and one below 50 indicates contraction).

&#160;

Irish house price inflation accelerated to 2.6% in August, and to 10.5% in Dublin. Cash buyers now account for close to 60% of transactions in the Irish housing market.

&#160;

British services output inched up in July and productivity rose across the economy for the first time in two years in the second quarter, suggesting the country's recovery is moving onto a firmer footing. The dominant service sector's output rose 0.2% in July from the previous month and 1.8% from July last year.

&#160;

<b>The story of the week for me</b>…is the Spanish government’s latest efforts to boost productivity. Spanish MPs are to consider changing their time zone to bring it in line with GMT (Greenwich Mean Time), claiming that it would improve eating, sleeping and working habits

<strong>"Trying times are not the times to stop trying."</strong>

<i>- Ray Owen </i>

&#160;

September surveys provided further evidence that the Eurozone recovery has gathered momentum. The final Markit Eurozone Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) composite output, based on surveys of manufacturing and the service sector, rose to a 27-month high of 52.2 in September. This is up from 51.5 in August (a reading above 50 is indicative of expansion and a reading below 50 is indicative of contraction).

&#160;

The Eurozone (EA17) seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 12.0% in August 2013. The EU28 unemployment rate was 10.9%. In both zones, rates have increased compared with August 2012, when they were 11.5% and 10.6% respectively.

&#160;

The European Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.5%.

&#160;

The World Bank lowered its forecasts for East Asia’s developing countries to grow at 7.1% for 2013, and 7.2% for 2014. The reasons cited were slower growth, lower investments and exports in most of the region's economies. As well as the need for structural and policy reforms to stabilise growth, ahead of monetary stimulus withdrawals and interest rate hikes in advanced economies.

&#160;

Business conditions continue to improve at a solid pace in the Japan. As the manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.5 in September from 52.2 in August (a reading above 50 is indicative of expansion and a reading below 50 is indicative of contraction).

&#160;

The Irish services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 56.8 in September, still indicating a robust pace of growth, but down substantially on the 61.6 recorded in August (a reading above 50 is indicative of expansion and a reading below 50 is indicative of contraction).

&#160;

<b>The story of the week for me…</b>is about the frenzy of excitement around Twitter's impending IPO. Some investors last week mistook the nearly worthless stock of long-dead electronics retailer Tweeter for the "tweeting" site, sending shares up more than 1,000%.

<strong> "They always say time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself.”</strong>

<i>- Andy Warhol </i>

&#160;

President Obama nominated Dr. Janet Yellen to succeed Ben Bernanke as chair of the Federal Reserve, and she will be the first women to lead the central bank, 100 years after its creation.

&#160;

The HSBC Emerging Markets Index (EMI), a monthly indicator derived from the PMI (purchasing managers' index) surveys, remained only just above the neutral threshold of 50.0 in September, signalling muted output growth in global emerging markets. The EMI was little-changed at 50.8, from 50.7 in August, and the average for Q3 (50.3) was the lowest since Q1 2009 during the global financial crisis.

&#160;

The International Monetary Fund cut its world growth forecast by 0.3% to 2.9% and next year by 0.2% to 3.6% amid deteriorating emerging market prospects, as the US prepares to exit its easy money policies and political stalemate in Washington DC threatens to disrupt the global recovery.

&#160;

The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that the United States will be the world's top producer of oil and natural gas hydrocarbons in 2013, surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia. For the United States and Russia, total petroleum and natural gas hydrocarbon production, in energy content terms, is almost evenly split between petroleum and natural gas. Saudi Arabia's production, on the other hand, heavily favours petroleum.

&#160;

UK industrial production for August dipped 1.1% in the month, abruptly ending a series of positive data on the British economy in recent months while in Germany, output rebounded after a dip in July.

&#160;

Irish consumer prices on average, as measured by the CPI, were 0.2% higher in September compared with September 2012, according to the CSO. The most notable changes in the year were increases in Alcoholic Beverages &amp; Tobacco (+4.8%), Education (+4.8%) and Miscellaneous Goods &amp; Services (+2.0%). There were decreases in Communications (-4.5%), Clothing &amp; Footwear (-4.1%), Furnishings, Household Equipment &amp; Routine Household Maintenance (-3.9%) and Transport (-2.7%).

&#160;

The stories of the week for me…Diamonds, the saying goes, are a girl's best friend. Jupiter and Saturn just might be full to the brim with them, according to scientists from the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences. Chunks of diamonds may be floating in hydrogen and helium fluid deep in the atmospheres of Saturn and Jupiter. What's more, at even lower depths, the extreme pressure and temperature can melt the precious gem, literally making it rain liquid diamonds.

<strong>"The greatest danger for most of us is not that we aim too high and we miss it, but we aim to low and reach it”</strong>

- Michelangelo

&#160;

Eurostat data released this week showed Spain, Greece and Ireland had the highest budget deficits in the EU in 2012. Ireland's deficit as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was 8.2%, behind Spain (10.6%) and Greece (9.0%).

&#160;

Spain's central bank announced an end to the country's two year recession as the Eurozone's fourth-largest economy gained from exports in the third quarter. The Banco de España (Spanish Central Bank) said Spain achieved a marginal growth rate of 0.1% from the previous quarter.

&#160;

US jobs numbers released this week were a lot worse than expected – coming in at 148,000 new payrolls in September versus an expected 180,000. The 430,000 jobs added in the three months to September is the slowest pace of growth since July 2012, suggesting that the thus-far resilient US recovery has succumbed to the avoidable sequester cuts and the shutdown/debt ceiling debacle. With the worst of the impact from the shutdown not hitting the economy until October, the jobs numbers could deteriorate further in the final quarter of the year.

&#160;

The Rightmove measure of asking prices in England and Wales released this week indicate asking prices in England &amp; Wales rose by 2.8% in October, up 3.8% on the year. Rightmove indicates that the strong rise on the month was driven by London (up 10.2% on the month) and the south-east (+2.3%) amid reports from estate agents of a buying frenzy in the capital with stocks in prime areas almost completely depleted.

&#160;

The first official estimate on how the UK economy has performed in the three months to the end of September was released last week. Rising by 0.8%% between July and September, which builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010.

&#160;

China's manufacturing activity rose to 7-month high in October boosted by a mini-stimulus program that includes faster spending on urban transport, tax breaks for business. The Flash China Manufacturing PMI (purchasing managers index) was at 50.9 (50.2 in September) - a seven-month high. Meanwhile, Flash China Manufacturing Output Index was at 51.0 (50.2 in September) - a six-month high.

&#160;

A report issued by the World Economic Forum affirmed the world’s gender gaps narrowed slightly this year. Iceland showed the least inequality among men and women, Finland ranked second followed by Norway and then Sweden, all unchanged from last year. Ireland maintained its position as sixth on the list.

&#160;

The Story of the week for me… A violin that was being played as the Titanic went down was sold for 900,000 pounds ($1.46 million) at auction, a record price for memorabilia from the lost ocean liner

<strong>"Things do not happen. Things are made to happen.”</strong>

- John F Kennedy

&#160;

The European Central Bank (ECB) cut its key interest rate to a new record low of 0.25%, responding to a plunge in inflation to 0.7% in October and weak Eurozone economic data. The rate change will take effect from 13th November.

&#160;

The European Commission released their economic growth forecasts for the second half of 2013, expecting a 0.5 % rise compared to the same period in 2012 in the EU. On an annual basis, real GDP growth for 2013 is estimated at 0.0 % in the EU and -0.4 % in the Eurozone. Looking ahead, economic growth is forecast to gradually gather pace over the forecast horizon, to 1.4 % in the EU and 1.1 % the Eurozone in 2014, reaching 1.9 % and 1.7 % in 2015, respectively.

&#160;

US nonfarm payroll employment rose by 148,000 in September while nonfarm payroll employment rose by 204,000 in October, the unemployment rate was little changed at 7.3%.

&#160;

The US economy grew at higher than expected growth in the third quarter (Q3). GDP (gross domestic product) grew at an annualised rate of 2.8% up from 2.5% in the second quarter (Q2).

&#160;

Gross capital investment by the US public sector has dropped to 3.6% of US economic output, the lowest since 1947, compared with a post WW2 average of 5%.

&#160;

The HSBC Emerging Markets Index (EMI), a monthly indicator derived from PMI surveys, signalled the fastest rise in output in seven months in October. At 51.7, the EMI remained well below its long-run trend level of 54.0. But the latest figure represented an improvement on the trend shown over Q3 (50.3), the lowest of any quarter since Q1 2009 during the global financial crisis (a reading over 50 indicates expansion and a reading under 50 indicates contraction).

&#160;

The number of new Irish private cars licensed reached 69,402 in the year to the end of October 2013, a fall of 6.3% compared to the same period in 2012.

&#160;

The year-on-year (YOY) rise in average Irish house/apartment rents nationwide accelerated to 4.8% in the third quarter (Q3) of 2013, up from 4.2% in the second quarter (Q2), according to the quarterly Daft.ie Rental Report. The acceleration is mainly due to trends outside Dublin, with rental inflation outside Dublin rising from 0.9% to 1.8% in recent months. In Dublin, rents were 7.6% higher than a year previously. This is related to very tight supply, with fewer than 1,500 properties available to rent on November 1, compared to over 6,700 on the same date four years previously. The average rent nationwide is now €824.

&#160;

The story of the week for me….following on from Venezuela’s toilet paper crisis a few months ago, the Venezuelan government has sent armed troops into a chain of electronics shops to force the company to start selling products at cheaper prices. This tactic was employed by President Nicolas Maduro’s socialist government in an effort to combat inflation, one of many economic problems hampering Venezuela’s economy.

<strong>"A goal without a plan is just a wish.”</strong>

- Antoine de Saint Exupery

&#160;

The Eurozone economy grew 0.1% in the third quarter (Q3) of 2013. The EU28 expanded by only 0.2%. France and Italy contracted (both at -0.1%) while growth in Europe's largest economy, Germany, was at 0.3%.

&#160;

Spanish inflation has gone to zero. The index of consumer prices has been revised down for October to 0.0% year on year. There was a small year-on-year drop in the price of services and a slowdown in the rise of price inflation in food, drink and tobacco prices.

&#160;

The Irish government formally announced that it will leave the EU/IMF programme of funding support without a precautionary credit line (PCL). Market reaction was negligible as it had been well flagged in advance.

&#160;

Figures from the Irish Banking Federation showed that new mortgage lending was €750m in Q3, up from €518m in Q2. But the bigger picture is that mortgage lending has been weak in 2013. Just €1.6bn of new mortgages have been drawn in the first nine months of the year. This suggests that the end-year figure will struggle to match the €2.6bn recorded in 2012, on current trends down at least 10%.

&#160;

The Bank of England (BOE) announced the UK economy is set to grow faster than it had expected in August, but stressed that a subdued outlook for inflation means it is still unlikely to raise interest rates soon. Releasing its latest quarterly forecasts, the BOE said the unemployment rate may fall to 7% much earlier than it had previously thought. The UK unemployment rate was reported at 7.6%, down from 7.8%.

&#160;

Japan's economy slowed to an annualised real growth of 1.9% in the July-September (Q3) period, following a 3.8% expansion the previous quarter (Q2). The data showed that exports dropped 0.6% from the previous quarter, while the rate of quarter-on-quarter growth in household consumption declined from 0.6% to 0.1%. Private residential investment rose by 2.7%.

&#160;

The Unites States trade deficit widened to $41.8bn in September from $38.7bn in August.

&#160;

The story of the week for me….A famous hotel rebuilt every winter in northern Sweden using only ice is to install fire alarms under the new National Housing Board rules.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So another “Movember” is just over, and wives and girlfriends around the world can breathe a sigh of relief as their partners get to shave their moustaches for the first time in a month.  Millions will have been raised around the world all going towards raising awareness and funds for mens health issues.

I recently attended the Dublin Web Summit, and Justin Coughlan, the co-founder of the <a href="http://ie.movember.com/" target="_blank">Movember</a> movement told us how the foundation grew from a group of mates in Melbourne deciding to grow their “Mo’s” for the month of November to becoming what is now, one of the top 100 Non-Government Organizations in the world.  Since its inception, they have raised over €321m!
<blockquote>Since its inception, they have raised over €321m!</blockquote>
Prostate and Testicular Cancer are still major killers of men in Ireland.  A look back at death claims paid out by Irish Life since 2008 show that 75 claims have been paid out for Testicular cancer and 282 for Prostate Cancer.  A more startling fact is uncovered when we examine the age profile of the claimants.  The average age for Testicular cancer claims is 38, with the youngest claim being  24 years old.  56 is the average age of Prostate cancer claimants, with 29 the youngest.

The <a href="http://www.cancer.ie/" target="_blank">Irish Cancer Society website</a> have a section on their website devoted to Men’s Health which includes <a href="http://www.cancer.ie/reduce-your-risk/mens-health/how-to-spot-cancer-early" target="_blank">tips on how to spot cancer early on</a>.  All men in the country should read it and be aware of the symptoms, as most cancers can be treated and cured if they are found early.

&#160;

So if you see a man over the remainder of the month sporting the classic handlebar look, or the wispy downy fluff(see my own pic on the left!), or anything inbetween, on their upper lip, know that they are suffering this embarrassment for a very good cause.  Give them a nod, a bit of encouragement or even put your hand in your pocket and donate a few quid to the cause because it all helps.  You can make a donation to the Irish Cancer Society by following <a href="http://www.cancer.ie/get-involved/fundraise/how-to-donate" target="_blank">this link.</a>

<title>Irish Life sparkles at the Annual Pension Awards</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thursday 27 November at the <a title="Pension Awards" href="http://www.europeanpensions.net/irishawards/index.php" target="_blank">Pension Awards</a> was a great night for Irish Life and our colleagues in Setanta Asset Management - we’re both part of the Great-West Lifeco family in case anyone doesn’t know yet!

Between us we picked up four prestigious awards at the <a title="Pension Awards 2013" href="http://www.europeanpensions.net/irishawards/index.php" target="_blank">Irish Pensions Awards 2013</a>. The Awards aim to recognise companies who have consistently delivered excellence, professionalism and dedication in maintaining the highest standards in Irish pension provision.

&#160;

<b>Irish Life Corporate Business</b> won both the ‘Communication Award’ and the ‘Innovation Award’. <b>Irish Life Investment Managers</b> were awarded ‘Investment Manager of the Year’ while <b>Setanta Asset Management</b> won ‘Equities Manager of the year’

&#160;
<h2 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">BOW TIES AND SPEECHES</h2>
This Black-Tie event was held in the new Double Tree Hilton Hotel (aka the Burlington).  As the evening kicked off, we nervously joked about acceptance speeches if we were honoured with a win. The nerves continued throughout the meal - similar I’m sure, to how members of a wedding party feel throughout their meal. We were relieved for a stint by MC, Neil Delamere, who’d make a great best man. His humour was as one person said was “on the right side of irreverent”.

&#160;
<h2 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">DRUM ROLL</h2>
Before we knew it, winners of the first few categories were announced. Colleagues and competitors, applauded and cheered. No tears, thankfully.

Patrick Burke, Managing Director Irish Life Investment Managers graciously accepted the award for Irish Life Investment Manager of the Year, a massive win for the business.

Equities Manager of the Year was announced, and we were thrilled to celebrate with our new colleagues in Setanta Asset Management.

Next up, Irish Life Corporate Business. We were announced as winners of the Communication Award. David Harney, Managing Director Irish Life Corporate Business and I made our way to the stage to collect the award. Thankfully collecting the award was all that was required - and no acceptance speeches were allowed (which was just as well - the nerves after facing Neil Delamere and the paparazzi would have got the better of me!) But that wasn’t all, we’d barely sat down again when David and Paula Martin, Senior Manager e-business Irish Life Corporate Business were called to the stage to accept the Innovation Award.

&#160;
<h2 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">STRENGTH IN NUMBERS</h2>
Four awards, what an honour - in a year of change for both Irish Life and Setanta.

We hope that this success is further evidence of our winning combination of global expertise and strength backed by local insight and customer care.
<blockquote><address><b><i>“To receive industry recognition awards for our commitment to delivering innovative products, backed by the highest standards of communication and service excellence. In a year of major change for everyone in Irish Life, this is a real badge of honour for us. We’re delighted.”</i></b></address></blockquote>

<strong>“A Pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.”</strong>

- Winston Churchill

&#160;

The planned €1.4bn sale of the semi-state company Bord Gáis Energy was put on hold as bids fell short of the government’s asking price.

&#160;

When Ireland joined the European Economic Community in 1973 55% of total exports went to the UK. This ratio dropped to 18% in 2012 while exports to the rest of the EU grew from 21% in 1973 to 40% in 2012 (the EEC/EU expanded from 6 to 27 countries over this time period).

&#160;

Irish House Prices rose 15% in Dublin in the year to October 2013 while residential property prices at a national level increased by 6.1%. This compares with an increase of 3.6% in September and a decrease of 8.1% recorded in the twelve months to October 2012. Mortgages issued at a national level are at the lowest level since 1974.

&#160;

According to the Central Bank, the number of Irish mortgages in arrears for more than 90 days rose in the third quarter (Q3) of the year compared to the previous three months. The proportion of residential mortgages in arrears greater than 90 days rose to 12.9% by the end of September, up from 12.7% in the previous three months.

&#160;

The Eurozone (EA17) seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 12.1% in October 2013; the EU28 unemployment rate was 10.9%. In both zones, rates have risen compared with October 2012, when they were 11.7% and 10.7% respectively.

&#160;

Eurozone annual inflation is expected to reach 0.9% in November 2013, up from 0.7% in October, according to a flash estimate from Eurostat released earlier in the week.

&#160;

The recovery in the Eurozone manufacturing sector accelerated again in November. Although the pace of expansion remained modest overall, the real positives were that growth extended into a fifth successive month with the rate of increase hitting a near two-and-half year high. Greek PMI (purchasing managers' index) rose for first time in 4 years.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me…</strong> Researchers at the Emory University School of Medicine, have shown that memories can be passed down to later generations through genetic switches that allow offspring to inherit the experience of their ancestors, according to new research that may explain how phobias can develop.

<strong>“It always seems impossible until it’s done.” </strong>

- Nelson Mandela

&#160;

The Bord Gáis Energy Index rose 4% in November 2013 as the four key commodities of the Index (oil, natural gas, coal and electricity) increased month-on-month. Both wholesale natural gas and electricity prices increased considerably (+6% and +8% respectively) over the month. Colder weather, some minor supply disruptions and a stronger pound versus the euro combined to raise the month-on-month wholesale prices.

&#160;

Irish unemployment rate fell to a low of 12.5% in November. This is the lowest rate recorded since June 2009.

&#160;

The US unemployment rate declined from 7.3% to 7.0% in November, and nonfarm payroll employment rose by 203,000. Employment rose in transportation and warehousing, health care, and manufacturing.

&#160;

Real US gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annualised 3.6% in the third quarter of 2013, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The growth rate was 0.8% more than the initial estimate released the previous month. In the second quarter, the growth rate was 2.5%.

&#160;

Trade ministers from 159 nations agreed the first global trade deal in decades and the only global agreement since the World Trade Organisation was founded in 1995. The ministers agreed a “trade facilitation” agreement to set common customs standards and ease the flow of goods through borders around the world. They also agreed on a range of issues from how the WTO should respond to government food security programmes to securing better market access to the rich world for the globe’s least developed economies.

&#160;

The HSBC Emerging Markets Index (EMI), a monthly indicator derived from the PMI (purchasing managers' index) surveys, continued its upward trajectory in November on the back of faster manufacturing growth. The EMI rose to 52.1, from 51.7 in October, signalling the fastest expansion in business activity across global emerging markets since March 2013.

&#160;

Bank of Ireland announced plans to raise €580m of equity through a share placing as part of a deal to repay €1.8bn of State-owned preference shares. The bank had faced a March 2014 deadline to pay the State back before a clause under its €4.8bnn bailout increased the cost of buying the shares back by 25%, or €450m.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me…</strong>is about inflation in Venezuela. In the run-up to December 8th municipal elections, President Nicolas Maduro's government launched an "economic offensive" to try to win over voters fed up with chronic shortages of basic goods and annual inflation of 54%. As a result, Venezuela's government said it was temporarily occupying the local subsidiary of multinational packaging company Smurfit Kappa accusing.

<strong>“<i>To climb steep hills requires slow pace at first.” </i></strong>

- Shakespeare

&#160;

Today Ireland will be the first nation in the euro zone to leave its bailout package provided by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund back in 2010 receiving the last tranche of funds from its European Union/International Monetary Fund €85bn loan on Friday.

&#160;

Irish industrial production fell by 11.6% in November. The fall reflected the pharmaceutical sector, with output down 23.3% on the month. In contrast, activity in the traditional manufacturing sector rose 0.3% in November, up 1.5% on the year.

&#160;

Annual consumer price inflation was 0.3% higher in November compared with November 2012, according to data released by the CSO. The most notable changes in the year were increases in Alcoholic Beverages &amp; Tobacco (+6.2%), Education (+4.5%) and Restaurants &amp; Hotels (+3.1%). There were decreases in Clothing &amp; Footwear (-4.6%), Furnishings, Household Equipment &amp; Routine Household Maintenance (-4.2%), Communications (-3.1%) and Transport (-1.7%).

&#160;

The average monthly standardised rent in Dublin in Q3 this year was €1,041, compared to €978 a year ago, and €1,015 in Q2 this year. For houses, it was €1,157 compared to €1,095 a year ago, and €1,124 in Q2 this year, while for apartments, it was €1,042 in Q3, compared with €983 a year ago, and €1,022 in Q2 this year. Outside Dublin, the average standardised rent in Q3 this year was €620, compared to €622 a year ago, and €612 in Q2 this year. For houses, the figure was €622 in Q3, compared with €619 a year ago, and €608 in Q2 this year, while for apartments, the figure was €624, compared with €636 a year ago and €627 in Q2 this year.

&#160;

In the month of October 2013, seasonally adjusted industrial production fell by 1.1% in the Eurozone (EA17) and by 0.7% in the EU28. Year on Year (YOY) industrial production increased by 0.2% in the Eurozone and by 0.8% in the EU28.

&#160;

A key element missing from the UK recovery story to date has been wage growth. Average weekly earnings grew by just 1% in the year to October, well below the current CPI inflation rate of 2.2%.

&#160;

The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Oil Market Report (OMR) raised the estimate of global oil demand for 2013 by 130,000 barrels per day (130 kb/d), to 91.2m barrels per day (mb/d), on stronger-than-expected third-quarter demand growth among OECD countries of 320 kb/d. Global demand is now seen advancing by 1.2 mb/d in both 2013 and 2014, to reach 92.4 mb/d in 2014.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me…</strong>Christmas in Texas has become even sweeter thanks to a giant gingerbread house that has broken a world record for confectionary construction. The recipe is simple; Mix 820 kg of butter, 1,327 kg of brown sugar, 7,200 eggs, 3,266 kg all-purpose flour, 31 kg ground ginger and a few other ingredients, bake and form into panels for mounting. Coming in at 35.8 million calories and covering an area of 2520 square feet, the 21-foot high gingerbread house has been declared the biggest gingerbread house by the Guinness World Records.

Irish GDP data showed a bounce-back in the second half of 2013. GDP is up 1.7% to the end of September 2013. The rise in Q3 was entirely driven by domestic demand, with consumer spending up 0.9% and a 10.9% rise in investment spending. In contrast, exports fell by 0.8%. The rebound in the Irish economy is consistent with the 3.2% employment growth recorded over the same period.

&#160;

The Irish Government released their Medium-Term Strategy with a commitment to balance the budget by 2018.

&#160;

The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) announced that “the Irish economy has turned the corner” as domestic demand in 2013 is estimated to have grown by 0.9%, the first increase in this aggregate since 2008.

&#160;

Credit agency Standard &amp; Poor's cut its long-term rating of the European Union by one notch to AA+ stating it had concerns about how the Eurobloc's budget was financed.

&#160;

The UK unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since 2009. At 7.4%, this is the lowest rate since the February-to-April period in 2009. The number of people out of work dropped by 99,000 to 2.39m in the three months to October.

&#160;

The US Federal Reserve announced it will reduce its $85 billion a month in bond purchases by $10 billion starting in January 2014. Markets rallied after the announcement and as a result the S&amp;P500 jumped 1.7% to a record close of 1,810.65.

&#160;

Revised GDP estimates show the U.S. economy grew 4.1% in the third quarter (Q3), the fastest rate of growth in almost two years. The upward revision was attributed to stronger business spending, pointing to some underlying strength that should be sustained.

<strong>The Story of the week for me…</strong>There was a time when outdoor Christmas decorations consisted of little more than a string of fairy lights hung loosely around a window frame and a holiday wreath stuck on the front door. Last week a Guinness World Record was set in Australia for the most number of Christmas lights, consisting of half a million lights (or 502,165 to be exact) spread along string which if you rolled it out straight would stretch a distance of 29.8 miles (48 km).

<strong>“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler” </strong>

- Albert Einstein

&#160;

The CSO announced that the number of new private cars licensed for the first time fell by 17.4% to 639 in December 2013 compared to December 2012 but up over 30% in January 2014 versus January 2013

&#160;

The value of Irish food and drink exports was roughly €10bn in 2013. This total amounts to 5.5% of expected total headline Irish exports in 2013. This represents an increase of 9% on the previous year and is up 40% in the last four years with revenues almost €3bn higher than in 2009

&#160;

Bids valued at €14bn were made for the new Irish 10-year bond issue, raising €3.5bn in total. Bond yields have fallen to the lowest since 2006, on signs that the State is making a successful return to debt markets. The bond was issued at 3.543%.

&#160;

The European Central Bank (ECB) left its key interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.25% despite concerns about a fragile recovery and falling inflation. In London, the Bank of England kept its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.5%.

&#160;

The Eurozone (EA17) seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 12.1% in November 2013, stable since April. The EU28 unemployment rate was 10.9%, stable since May. In both zones, the rates increased compared with November 2012, when they were 11.8% and 10.8% respectively. The lowest rate was in Austria at 4.8% and the highest was in Spain at 26.7%.

&#160;

The US added only 74,000 jobs in December but the jobless rate fell to 6.7% as the workforce reduced.

&#160;

The HSBC Emerging Markets Index (EMI), a monthly indicator derived from the PMI (purchasing managers' index) surveys, signalled overall growth of output across global emerging markets in December. The EMI fell to 51.6, from 52.1 in November, signalling a weaker rate of expansion.

&#160;

Japan's Nikkei 225 had its best performance since 1972, 41 years ago while in the US, the Dow Industrial Average had its best year since 1995.

&#160;

Commodity prices fell in 2013 for the first time since 2008 as the Federal Reserve announced a taper of its monthly bond purchases; China scaled back metal demand while record harvests are maintaining a downward pressure on food prices and gold and silver plunged the most since 1981 against a backdrop of improving prospects for the world economy. In the currency markets, while the euro rose against the US dollar, the currency is up against most other currencies.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me… </strong>Most adults struggle to recall events from their first few years of life and now scientists have identified exactly when these childhood memories fade and are lost forever. A new study into childhood amnesia – the phenomenon where early memories are forgotten – has found that it tends to take affect around the age of seven.

<strong>“<i>We build too many walls and not enough bridges”</i></strong>

- Isaac Newton

&#160;

Moody's Investors Service on Friday restored an investment grade rating to Ireland after it had cut Irish sovereign debt to junk status in 2011. The agency upgraded Ireland's government debt ratings to Baa3/P-3 from Ba1/NP and the outlook on the ratings is now positive.

&#160;

Prices on average, as measured by the CPI (consumer price index), were 0.2% higher in December compared with December 2012. The price of goods fell by 0.9% and the most notable changes in the year were increases in Alcoholic Beverages &amp; Tobacco (+5.7%), Education (+4.5%) and Restaurants &amp; Hotels (+2.8%). There were decreases in Clothing &amp; Footwear (-4.0%), Furnishings, Household Equipment &amp; Routine Household Maintenance (-3.7%), Communications (-2.4%), Transport (-1.1%) and Food &amp; Non-Alcoholic Beverages (-1.1%).

&#160;

The ESRI/KBC measure of consumer confidence surged in December, to its highest level since June 2007, as Ireland exited the EU/IMF bailout.

&#160;

The European Commission has warned in its latest quarterly economic report on the Eurozone that per capita living standards could fall to 60% of US levels by 2023, which would be a ratio comparable with the mid-1960s.

&#160;

Spain's economy grew the most since Q1 2008 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 0.3% in the three months to December, compared with a 0.1% rise in output in the third quarter of 2013.

&#160;

Eurozone seasonally adjusted industrial production rose 1.8% in the month of November 2013 and it expanded by 1.5% in the EU28.

&#160;

According to leading indicators published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), growth is set to improve in most large economies during the first half of 2014, with the exception of India, which is set for a slowdown.

&#160;

The World Bank revised up its global GDP forecast to 3.2% in 2014.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me…</strong>Davos 2014, the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum is set to open on Wednesday with more than 2,500 due to attend at an average cost of $40,000 per ticket.

<strong>“<i>You will never find time for anything. If you want the time, you must make it.”</i></strong>

- Charles Buxton

&#160;

According to data released by Eurostat Ireland was the only country in the EU to experience disinflation between 2008 and 2012, but prices remain high by EU standards. Ireland was the fifth most expensive EU state in 2012, after Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Luxembourg with prices 15% above the EU average. However, this represents a considerable improvement on 2008 when Irish prices were the second highest in the EU, at 30% above the EU average.

&#160;

Dublin house prices rose 15.7% last year; National prices are up 6.4%. Residential property prices in Dublin are 49.1% lower than at their highest level in February 2007. The fall in the price of residential properties in the rest of Ireland is somewhat lower at 46.8%. Overall, the national index is 46.4% lower than its highest level in 2007

&#160;

Eurozone public debt fell for the first in the three months to September, since the end of 2007, giving a positive signal after years marked by crisis.

&#160;

From a high level, German economic sentiment fell slightly in the latest survey. In January 2014 the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment fell only marginally by 0.3 points and now stands at the 61.7 points-mark (historical average: 24.4 points).

&#160;

The UK unemployment rate has fallen to 7.1%, just above the level at which the Bank of England has said it will consider raising interest rates. The jobless fall was the biggest since 1997.

&#160;

China's economy grew 7.7% year on year in 2013, the same as 2012 while beating the government's target of 7.5%

&#160;

Global growth is expected to increase in 2014 after having been stuck in low gear in 2013, says the IMF’s latest WEO Update. The IMF forecasts global growth to average 3.7% in 2014―up from 3% in 2013―and to rise to 3.9% in 2015.

&#160;

Investors start 2014 more optimistic about global growth prospects, especially for the US but increasingly for Europe as well, according to the BofA Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey for January 2014. The proportion of investors who believe the global economy will strengthen this year has risen to a net 75% from a net 71% in December, continuing a trend of rising optimism that started in late 2012.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me…</strong>A new food fad is sweeping South Korea - gastronomic voyeurism, or watching people eat online. There are about 3,500 people in South Korea doing such online programmes, some sponsored by restaurants. Some say it makes eating alone feel less awkward.

<strong>“<i>Life is like a riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving”</i></strong>

- Albert Einstein

&#160;

Quarterly National Accounts for Q3 2013 still show that Irish household debt remains exceptionally high. However, household net worth rose by 3.5% on the quarter to €489.6bn, or €106,605 per capita. This was the largest increase in Irish household net worth since Q4 2006. In part, the rise in net worth reflected households saving to reduce their debts. Household debt fell by €1.6bn on the quarter to €168.6bn, €36,717 per capita. Nonetheless, Irish household debt still remains exceptionally high by international standards at 196.1% of disposable income, down by 2.1 percentage points on the quarter.

&#160;

The Eurozone (EA17) seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 12.0% in December 2013 and has been stable since October. The EU28 unemployment rate was 10.7% in December 2013, down from 10.8% in November. Jobless numbers rose by 130,000.

&#160;

Recent upward pressure on European short-term borrowing rates had prompted some commentators to suggest a further ECB rate cut may be likely.

&#160;

Investors resumed their flight from emerging markets despite the latest round of central bank interventions to allay concerns about rising economic and political hazards in developing countries. The MSCI Emerging Markets index is down -4.4% percent for the month of January, the weakest start to a year since 2009.

&#160;

The UK economy grew by 1.9% in 2013, its strongest rate since 2007, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). GDP (gross domestic product) increased by 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2013. However, the Office for National Statistics’ Q4 GDP first estimate is based only on survey data for October and November. So the GDP figures are still likely to be revised.

&#160;

The US economy grew at a slower annualised rate than the third quarter's 4.1% growth, the final six months of the year delivered the strongest second half since 2003 boosted by exports, consumer spending and business investment. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased 3.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013, according to the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the third quarter, the growth rate was 4.1%. For the full year 2013, real GDP increased 1.9%, compared with 2.8% in 2012.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me…</strong>A Guinness world record for the region with the most lightning has been given to the North-western state of Zulia in Venezuela. Producing up to 3,600 flashes per hour and 1.2 million a year with the number of lightning bolts estimated at 18 to 60 per minute. Each flash packs enough energy to light up 100 million light bulbs between the months of April to November every year.

<strong> “<i>One can choose to go back to safety or forward toward growth” </i></strong>

- Abraham Maslow

&#160;

Rising Irish wholesale electricity and coal prices offset decreasing oil and wholesale natural gas prices resulting in a 1% month-on-month increase in the Bord Gáis Energy Index in January.

&#160;

The year-on-year increase in the average rent nationwide accelerated to 7.1% in the final quarter of 2013, up from 2.2% a year previously, according to the quarterly Daft.ie Rental Report. The average advertised rent nationwide is now €865, compared to €790 two years ago. The average rise in Dublin was 11.2% to €1,210. The acceleration in rent inflation is due mainly to trends in Dublin, with rental inflation in the capital rising from 4.9% to 11.2% in the same period. Rents are now 17.6% higher than their lowest point in this cycle, which occurred three years ago, and 15.7% below peak levels of 2007.

&#160;

The Irish construction sector continued to show further growth at the start of 2014, the Ulster Bank Construction PMI shows. The index, which was released this morning, came in at 56.4 in January, down from 58.3 in December but still signalling a strong monthly increase in activity. A reading above 50 indicates expansion while below 50 signifies contraction. Within the residential segment of the index, where activity remains around a 40-year low, the PMI stood at 59.8 in January compared to 63.2 in December while in the commercial sector it fell to 59.3 from 63.2 the previous month. Strong gains in new orders helped produce the fifth consecutive month of increasing employment while business sentiment was only slightly weaker than December’s record high as firms forecast further growth in activity during 2014.

&#160;

Output in the Eurozone economy expanded for the seventh successive month in January. At 52.9, up from 52.1 in December, the final Markit Eurozone PMI (purchasing managers' index) Composite Output Index posted its highest reading since June 2011, but nudged lower from the flash estimate of 53.2. The upturn was led by the manufacturing sector, where accelerated growth of both total new orders and new export business drove the rate of expansion in production to a near three-year record

&#160;

Business activity across emerging markets expanded in January at the slowest pace in four months, dragged down by sluggish services sectors in the BRIC quartet of big developing countries. HSBC's composite emerging markets index of manufacturing and services purchasing managers' surveys slipped for the second month running to 51.4 in January. A reading above 50 indicates expansion while below 50 signifies contraction.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me…</strong>Silvio Berlusconi is not giving up. Despite a conviction for tax fraud, clandestine scandals and a ban on him running for office, the billionaire leader of Italy’s centre-right is said to be planning

<strong>“<i>To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all” </i></strong>

- Oscar Wilde

Analysis published by Credit Suisse revealed the real value of Irish equities, with income reinvested, grew by a factor of 96.6 in the 114 years from 1900-2013, compared to 4.9 for bonds.

&#160;

According to the CSO, Irish prices as measured by the CPI (consumer price index) were 0.2% higher in January 2014, compared with January 2013. The most notable changes in the year were increases in Education (+4.6%), Alcoholic Beverages &amp; Tobacco (+4.3%) and Miscellaneous Goods &amp; Services (+2.8%). There were decreases in Furnishings, Household Equipment &amp; Routine Household Maintenance (-3.3%), Communications (-2.4%), Clothing &amp; Footwear (-2.3%) and Transport (-2.1%).

&#160;

A new study based on an analysis of the Property Price Register shows that the number and value of transactions in Dublin rose substantially during 2013. The study reveals that the number of house sales in the capital last year rose to 10,000, an increase of 17% on 2012. There were 246 sales in Dublin for €1m or more. The lowest price achieved was €6,000 in respect of a house in Marino. The most popular areas to buy property were Dublin 15 (697), Dublin 14 (649), Dublin 16 (605), Dublin 18 (522) and Dublin 6 (512). Dublin dominates the market as it accounts for over a third of the 29,200 houses sold in the country last year. However house sales outside Dublin are also up 17%, driven in the main by increased sales in Cork, Limerick and Galway.

&#160;

The UK's annual inflation rate, as measured by the consumer prices index, dropped to 1.9% in January. This is the first fall below the Bank of England's 2% target in more than four years.

&#160;

China's manufacturing contracted in February according to a flash purchasing managers’ index (PMI), which dropped to a seven-month low of 48.3 in February, from 49.5 the previous month. The period included the Lunar New Year shutdown. A reading above 50 indicates expansion while below 50 signifies contraction.

&#160;

According to the BofA Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey for February, a growing proportion of investors (46% in February) acknowledge that a hard landing in China and commodity collapse represent the biggest tail risk to the global economy. That figure compares with 37% in January and 26% in December. Belief in global economic growth has moderated, 56% expect the global economy to strengthen in the coming 12 months, down 19% from 75% last month. Global equity allocations are down; 45% of asset allocators say they are overweight equities, down from 55% in January.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me…</strong> Most people entering crocodile territory keep a wary eye out on water and land, but research suggests they need to look up. Though the reptiles lack obvious physical features to suggest this is needed, crocodiles in fact climb trees all the way to the crowns, according to University of Tennessee researcher Vladimir Dinets.

<title>MedCare – Medical Second Opinion service from MediGuide</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[&#160;

If you, or a member of your family, have ever been diagnosed with a serious illness or medical condition, you will know how overwhelming this can be.  The focus switches quickly to working with your doctor to consider every possible option around finding the best treatment plan. Imagine how comforting it could be at this difficult time to know that amongst your options could be a second opinion on your diagnosis and treatment plan from one of the world’s leading medical centres.

That’s why Irish Life has just launched<strong> Med</strong>Care – as part of our new LifeCare range of services.
<strong>Med</strong>Care gives you access to a Medical Second Opinion service provided by MediGuide, a company in the USA.

<strong>Med</strong>Care is currently available to customers who start a new Protection plan from 3rd February 2014 with Irish Life – excluding the Over 50s and Simple Life Insurance plans.

With <strong>Med</strong>Care, if you are diagnosed with one of the conditions covered by MediGuide, you can access a review of your diagnosis and treatment plan from one of 90 leading medical centres worldwide, who are at the forefront of medical research and advances in diagnoses and treatment.

In the U.S., for example, many of these medical centres are specialists in particular illnesses such as cancer or cardiovascular-related conditions. And, as they are typically based in cities or regions that have large populations, they tend to have a lot of experience of applying cutting-edge science to diagnosing conditions on a regular basis. Click here to see the current list of medical centres: <a title="medcare medical centers" href="http://www.irishlife.ie/life-assurance/medcare-medical-centers.html" target="_blank">http://www.irishlife.ie/life-assurance/medcare-medical-centers.html</a>

The health conditions and illnesses covered under the Medical Second Opinion service range from cancer and cardiovascular disorders to arthritis, asthma and female infertility. To see the full list, log on to <a href="http://www.irishlife.ie/medcare-conditions.html">http://www.irishlife.ie/medcare-conditions.html</a>.

And, as an extra benefit, the service can also be used by your spouse / partner, your children, your parents and your spouse’s / partner’s parents. Once you have an Irish Life plan, there is no additional  cost to you for requesting or receiving a Medical Second Opinion.

So<ins cite="mailto:Michelle%20Kearns" datetime="2014-02-14T12:20"> </ins>if you are thinking about life insurance, it may be worth checking out the range of services currently offered by Irish Life. For further details on <strong>Med</strong>Care and the Medical Second Opinion service, talk to your financial adviser or log on to irishlife.ie/medcare.

<strong>“The absence of alternatives clears the mind marvellously”</strong>

- Henry Kissinger

&#160;

Irish employment increase by 3.3% or 61,000 in the year to the fourth quarter of 2013, bringing total employment to 1,909,800 (the highest number since June 2009) driven by Agriculture, forestry and fishing (+29.8% or 26,800), Accommodation and food service activities (+14.7% or 17,400) and Professional, scientific and technical activities (+12.7% or 13,000).

&#160;

UK house purchase data showed a surge in mortgage approvals to just below 50,000 in January, the highest level in six years.

&#160;

Eurozone Growth forecasts were raised to 1.1% by the European Commission. Economic data over recent quarters has confirmed a gradual recovery in the euro area.

&#160;

Eurozone annual inflation was confirmed at 0.8% in January 2014, stable compared to December 2013. A year earlier the rate was 2.0%. Monthly inflation was -1.1% in January 2014.

&#160;

The Cyprus government resigned on Friday after parliament failed to approve draft legislation to privatise three state utilities as part of the island’s €10bn bailout by international lenders.

&#160;

 French unemployment was at a record high in January. The latest figure brings the total number of unemployed to a record 3.23m – about 11% of the workforce. The total number of those seeking a full-time job, including those in part-time work, reached 4.92m.

&#160;

US real GDP (which measures output produced in the United States) grew at an annual rate of 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2013.

&#160;

Russia's central bank unexpectedly raised its policy interest rate sharply to 7% from 5.5%. The Bank of Russia's move came as the Russian rubble plunged to record lows following Moscow's intervention in Ukraine.

&#160;

Commodities advanced to their highest levels in almost six months as escalating tension in Ukraine fuelled concern that energy and agricultural supplies will be disrupted while increasing demand for gold as a haven. Brent crude in London jumped 2 %, wheat in Chicago surged 4.7 %, while gold futures in New York increased 1.3 %. Natural gas and corn also advanced.

&#160;

<b>The Story of the week for me…</b>Mt Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy in a Tokyo district court. After 744,408 bitcoins, valued at more than $390 million were reported stolen. Mt Gox once claimed to host nearly 80 percent of all bitcoin transactions worldwide, and was the primary source cited for bitcoin prices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Who knows how to handle claims the best?</h1>
&#160;

Irish Life was already the biggest payer of death and illness claims in Ireland up to this point, but now with the addition of the Canada Life business, the biggest payer of life insurance and protection claims just got substantially bigger.

In 2013 we paid on average €675,000 in death and illness claims every single working day - over €168m in total.

&#160;

Since we launched partial payments in 2009, Irish Life has paid 56 partial payment illness claims. Some examples we paid in 2013 were for ductal carcinoma of the breast, severe burns, cerebral aneurysm and surgical removal of one eye.

&#160;
<h3 style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Death Claims</h3>
Over 35% of our claims were in the age group 41-60, the prime age for parents to ensure that they have adequate life insurance in place.

The biggest cause of death for males aged 40-49 are accidents, followed by heart related deaths, and then cancer.

The average death claim amount is still low - and only 1 in 5 death claims was for over €100,000. The largest death claim paid was for €1.1 million.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Irish Life Investment Managers, as part of the Irish Life Corporate responsibility programme work with Business in the Community (BITC - <a title="BITC" href="http://www.bitc.ie" target="_blank">www.bitc.ie</a>).

Having establishes a very successful link with Patrician College a secondary school in Finglas, BITC approached ILIM in 2010 and asked them to be one of the six participants in the "Time to Read" pilot programme. This is a programme aimed at primary schools to assist 7 and 8 year olds with their reading.

Irish Life were delighted to get involved and were linked with St Finian’s National School in Finglas. The results of the pilot were extremely positive and the programme was rolled out to various primary schools in Ireland in 2012.

Irish Life has maintained its link with St Finian’s and the Time to Read programme continues every Tuesday morning when volunteers from Irish Life read with children in the school.

In addition the children visit their local library to understand the benefits of same and the children also do a site visit to Irish Life. To date about 20 staff has been involved with the programme.

The "Time to Read" programme will be featured on RTÉs Nationwide programme Monday 10th March 7pm.

<strong>“Vision is the art of seeing the invisible” </strong>

Jonathan Swift

&#160;

Irish pension managed funds delivered a positive month of returns during February, with an average return of 2.5% for the month. Irish Life Investment Managers took the top spot with a return of 2.9% for the month.

&#160;

The Bord Gáis Energy Index fell 5% in February due to month-on-month falls in wholesale gas and electricity prices. Approximately 23% of Ireland’s electricity demand was met by wind, which displaced more expensive gas powered plants and helped lower Irish wholesale electricity prices. The Index currently stands at 140, which is 7% lower than February 2013 and 40% up on December 2009.

&#160;

The KBC Ireland/ESRI Consumer Sentiment Index increased to 85.5 in February, from 84.6 in January and 59.4 in February last year.

&#160;

The Central Bank reported that the number of Irish mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses (PDH) fell by 3.3% to 136,564 in Q4 2013 from 141,269 at the end Q3. This represents 17.9% of the total mortgage market. However, accounts 360 days+ in arrears grew to 60,422. The value of PDH mortgages in arrears is €24.4bn.

&#160;

The recession-scarred Spanish labour market passed a milestone as employment showed its first annual rise since the start of the financial crisis in 2008. After 68 consecutive months of losses and stagnation, the number of employed Spaniards rose to 16.2 million in February, 60,000 higher than the same month last year.

&#160;

The EU confirmed that, following the end of Ireland’s EU-IMF bailout, Ireland is now subject to two review missions a year until 75 per cent of the State’s bailout loans are paid back. The last ESM loan is scheduled to be repaid in 2042.

&#160;

The European Central Bank (ECB) left its key interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.25% despite concerns about credit availability in struggling economies and falling inflation. In London, the Bank of England kept its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.5%.

The HSBC Emerging Markets Index (EMI), a monthly indicator derived from the PMI (purchasing managers' index) surveys, fell for the third month running to 51.1 in February 2014, from 51.4 in the first month of 2014. That signalled the weakest growth in global emerging market output since last September, with the EMI also remaining well below its long-run trend level of 54.0.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me…</strong>A team of engineers led by SAP have set a new Guinness World Record for the largest data warehouse, a 12.1 petabyte data warehouse. To give you an idea on just how big 12.1 petabytes is, a single petabyte of MP3 songs, each 4 minutes long, would take 2,000 years to play.

<h3>Cancer Remains Leading Cause of Death and Illness</h3>
&#160;

Today we revealed our annual claims data which once again provides a valuable insight into the health of the nation. The data details the illnesses and conditions that led to payments of over €168 million in Life Insurance and Specified Illness Cover claims in 2013. Here are some main figures;

• €112.4 million paid in Life Insurance for 1,714 deceased customers

•  €56.4 million paid for 810 Specified Illness Cover claims

•  That’s €449,800 in Life Insurance claims and €225,600 in Specified Illness Cover claims every working day during 2013

•  Cancer and heart-related complaints remain the two main overall causes of both Life Insurance and Specified Illness Cover claims

•  Significant gender differences – percentage of heart related conditions for men was double the rate for women

•  Almost half (47%) of all life cover claims for people under 40 were as a result of accidents

•  Largest Life Insurance payment was €1.15 million and largest Specified Illness Cover claim was €1.1 million


The analysis of the claims book, which for 2013 includes data from both Irish Life and Canada Life, reports that €112.4 million was paid out for 1,714 Life Insurance claims and a further €56.4 million for 810 Specified Illness Cover claims. The average payment was €65,560 in respect of Life Insurance claims and €69,638 for Specified Illness Cover claims although the figures show wide variations in the size of claims settled.

Commenting on the data Gerry Hassett, our Managing Director, Irish Life Retail said: <em>“The scale of the Life Insurance and Specified Illness Cover claims paid shows that it is crucially important for people to look after the interests of their dependants in the event of death and serious illness.”</em>

He added: <em>“It also makes financial sense when you consider that a healthy 30-year old non-smoker will pay just under €38 per month for €100,000 life cover and €100,000 Independent Specified Illness cover, assuming a 20 year term.”</em>

<b> </b>The 2013 claims book shows that cancer remains the biggest cause of both Life Insurance and Specified Illness Cover claims, accounting for 44 per cent of Life Insurance claims and 58 per cent of Specified Illness Cover claims, with heart-related conditions accounting for 16 per cent of Life Insurance claims and 22 per cent of Specified Illness Cover claims.

<strong>Gender variations</strong>

The figures, however, show significant variations between males and females in the cause of claims. While cancer accounted for more than half of Life Insurance claims for females the corresponding figures for males was 41 per cent while heart-related conditions accounted for double the level of claims for males as for females.

The disparity between males and females was even more pronounced in the case of Specified Illness Cover claims. Cancer accounted for almost three quarters of female Specified Illness Cover claims but just under half of male claims, while heart-related conditions accounted for more than one third of male Specified Illness Cover claims but just 7 per cent of female claims.

The largest single Life Insurance claim paid out by Irish Life and Canada Life in 2013 was over €1 million in respect of a male in his 50s, while the largest claim paid out for a female was almost €800,000 for a customer in her 50s. In the case of Specified Illness Cover claims, the largest payment was €1.1 million to a male in his 40s for cancer, while €380,000 was paid to a female in her 40s, also for cancer.

The figures also show that of the 138 claims paid out for accidental death, 25 were the result of a road traffic accident, which equated to €2 million in payments. Alcohol was a factor in 6 per cent of all accident claims, which is down slightly from 7 per cent in 2012, and 14 per cent in 2011.

We paid out many claims shortly after the cover was taken out, for example a 60-year-old female was paid €250,000 for a Specified Illness Cover just 17 weeks after she took out the policy. In the case of Life Insurance claims, the estate of a male in his 50s was paid over €500,000 just six months after the policy was taken out and €30,000 was paid to the dependents of a customer who died in an accident three months after he started the cover.

<strong>“Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better”</strong>

- Samuel Beckett

&#160;

Consumer Prices in February, as measured by the CPI (consumer price index), increased by 0.5% month-on-month and was 0.1% lower Year-on-Year. This is the first time since July 2010 that the CPI has fallen on an annual basis. The most notable changes in the year were decreases in Communications (-4.0%), Furnishings, Household Equipment &amp; Routine Household Maintenance (-3.6%), Clothing &amp; Footwear (-3.4%) and Transport (-2.0%). There were increases in Education (+4.6%), Alcoholic Beverages &amp; Tobacco (+3.3%) and Miscellaneous Goods &amp; Services (+3.2%).

&#160;

New cars licensed in February were up 23% on 2013 levels and new goods vehicles licensed were up by 45%. This provides further evidence that the rebound in Irish consumer and business confidence has led households and companies to increase their spending.

&#160;

Irish national accounts data showed Irish GDP was down 0.3% in 2013 but GNP was up 3.4%.

&#160;

The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has raised €1 billion in an auction of benchmark 10-year bonds, reaching its target in the first regular sale of Government debt since exiting the bailout in December. The agency said it received total bids of 2.9 times the amount on offer, with a yield of 2.967%.

&#160;

ECB governing council member Christian Noyer indicated that he sees the strong euro creating economic pressures. While not advocating any explicit action to weaken the euro, Noyer did suggest the ECB end sterilisation of the now defunct SMP bond buying programme in order to flatten money market curves.

&#160;

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney indicated that he believes a 2-3% range for UK interest rates over the medium term is plausible.

&#160;

New York, London, Hong Kong and Singapore remain the top four global financial centres. Dublin's IFSC slips to 66 of 83 cities -- down 10 ranks in the biannual survey of financial services professionals and is ranked number 19 of the top 20 European centres.

&#160;

Recovery is under way in the world’s advanced economies, underpinned by supportive financial conditions and reduced drag from budgetary tightening, but activity in the major emerging markets is mixed, according to the OECD’s latest Interim Economic Assessment.

&#160;

Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science &amp; Technology Co. failed to make an 89.8 million yuan ($14.7 million) interest payment. This is the first domestic corporate bond default in the history of the People’s Republic of China.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me… </strong>Environmental engineers and coastal erosion researchers estimate that Ireland is 250 acres smaller – as the recent floods and storms tore large blocks off the country's coastline.

<title>Hey Superwoman – yes I mean you!</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I know women often think they are invincible. I see women in my life laugh at the thought of manflu and play things down if they’re not feeling great. We just keep going no matter what!

But I’m sure we can all think of women in our lives that were hit out of the blue with a serious illness or died suddenly. My grandmother passed away from breast cancer at 68. She would never entertain the thought of being ill and was one of the toughest women I know, she sure seemed like Superwoman to me.

Unfortunately no matter how tough we feel and healthy our lifestyle, we can’t take our good health as a given. This is brought home to us in Irish Life every time we look at all the life insurance and specified illness insurance claims we pay to our customers.

<strong>Some of Irish Life’s 2013 claim statistics:</strong>
<ul class="listdot">
<li>We paid out €168 million in life and specified illness insurance claims to both men and women.</li>
<li>We paid out 579 life insurance claims and 344 specified illness insurance claims to women.</li>
<li>38% of all our life and specified illness insurance claims are paid to women.</li>
<li>The average age of women making specified illness claims was just 53.</li>
<li>The most common cause of claims for women is cancer (malignant), followed by stroke (resulting in permanent symptoms).</li>
<li>We paid one customer who was diagnosed with a benign brain tumour €100,000. She only had her plan in place with us for 12 weeks.</li>
<li>We paid the family of a customer €100,000 when she passed away from sudden adult death syndrome. She had her plan for just 2 years.</li>
</ul>
Most women make a big contribution to their households either through working or looking after the family so it’s important to consider the financial impact if something were to happen to you. I know it’s not a happy thought but maybe just for today imagine what would happen if you couldn’t be Superwoman someday.

You can find more information on the claims we paid in 2013 <a href="http://www.irishlife.ie/customer-service/claims-hub/claims-stats-2013-life-illness.html">here</a> or you can get a quote for life insurance <a href="https://www.irishlife.ie/secureWeb/life-assurance/life-insurance-quote-from-15-per-month.html">here</a>.

Remember you must keep up payments to stay on cover. Please see our product booklets for more information.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>“Patience is the companion of wisdom”</strong>

- St. Augustine

&#160;

The Irish Quarterly Rent Index shows continued growth in Dublin Rents of 2.1% for Q4 2013, while outside Dublin rents dropped by 0.9%. On an annual basis, this means that rents in Dublin grew by 7.6%, comparing Q4 of 2013 to Q4 of 2012. In contrast, the market outside Dublin posted an increase of 1.1%.

&#160;

Ryanair announced plans to issue a bond allowing the carrier to access capital markets as it looks for secured and unsecured debt financing for its order of 175 Boeing 737 aircraft.

&#160;

The European Union’s plan for an integrated banking union passed a decisive milestone after member states and the European Parliament reached agreement on the Single Resolution Mechanism, a centralised resolution body and accompanying €55 billion fund that will be responsible for winding-up troubled banks in the Eurozone.

&#160;

Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, announced a $10bn package of tax cuts and other measures to revive growth in Italy’s stagnant economy, increase investment in education and create jobs in particular for young people at a time of high unemployment.

&#160;

Greece reached a deal with international lenders on a range of structural reforms that will allow it to unlock €10bn tranche of bailout aid. The €10bn payment will cover sovereign bond repayments which are due in May.

&#160;

The flash estimate of the Markit Eurozone Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) came in at 53.2, only slightly lower than February’s 32-month high of 53.3 and registering expansion for the ninth consecutive month. A reading above 50 indicates expansion while below 50 signifies contraction.

&#160;

The Federal Reserve’s new forecasts, released yesterday, expect policy rates to increase to 1% by the end of 2015, and to 2.25% by the end of 2016. The Federal Reserve also tapered its monthly asset purchases by another $10bn, to $55bn.

&#160;

Financing provided by venture capital for developing companies, mainly in the high tech sector, last year amounted to $33bn in the US; $7.1bn in Europe; $3.5bn in China and $2.3bn in Israel. In Ireland VC financing amounted to$364m.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me… </strong>An ornament bought by a scrap dealer to be melted down for its gold has turned out to be a missing Faberge egg worth £20 million. The Imperial Easter Egg was designed by Carl Fabergé for Tsar Alexander III in 1887 and seized by the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution.

<strong>“I think of life as a good book. The further you get into it. The more it begins to make sense<i>”</i></strong>

- Harold Kushner

&#160;

The number of new Irish start-ups is reported to have risen by an average of 127 per day in Q1 2014.

&#160;

In the year to February, residential property prices at a national level, increased by 8.1%. Compared to an increase of 6.3% in January and a decrease of 2.6% recorded in the twelve months to February 2013. In Dublin residential property prices fell by 0.6% in February and were 13.3% higher than a year ago.

&#160;

Irish home mortgage approvals in February 2014 on an annualised basis were at the lowest since 1972, even though Ireland's population has grown by 53% in the interval from 3m to 4.6m.

&#160;

Eurozone annual inflation is expected to be 0.5% in March 2014, down from 0.7% in February, according to a flash estimate from Eurostat, the statistics office of the European Union.

&#160;

In 2013, average hourly labour costs in the whole economy excluding agriculture and public administration were estimated to be €23.7 in the EU28 and €28.4 in the Eurozone EA17. The lowest hourly labour costs were recorded in Bulgaria €3.7, Romania €4.6, Lithuania €6.2 and Latvia €6.3, and the highest in Sweden €40.1, Denmark €38.4, Belgium €38.0, Luxembourg €35.7 and France €34.3. They were at €29.0 in Ireland.

&#160;

Frankfurt, the Eurozone's financial capital, is named Europe’s trading hub for the Chinese yuan/renminbi.

&#160;

Unemployment in France rose 0.9% in February. The data show that the number of people registered as jobless reached a record 3,347,700, the highest since 1996, up 0.9% over the previous month and 4.7% in the year.

&#160;

The US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is up an annualised 2.6% in Q4 2013.

&#160;

US consumer confidence unexpectedly rose in March and is now at its highest level since the crisis began sitting at 82.3, the highest since January 2008, from an upwardly revised 78.3 in February.

&#160;

Russia’s credit rating outlook was cut to negative from stable by Standard &amp; Poor’s, which said economic risks have risen because of Western sanctions over the seizure of Ukraine’s breakaway Crimea region.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me…</strong>  A 33-year-old man has set a Guinness World record

<strong>“Never be afraid to sit a while and think<i>” </i></strong>

<i>– Lorraine Hansberry </i>

&#160;

The Bord Gáis Energy Index rose 1% in March as a 6% month-on-month rise in Irish wholesale electricity prices was offset by falling oil (down 1% month-on-month) and wholesale UK gas prices (down 5% month-on-month). The index is up 41% since the start of 2010.

&#160;

The Central Bank expects GDP (gross domestic product) to grow by 2% this year, powered by employment growth, investment by companies and improving economic growth overseas.

&#160;

The average asking price for properties outside of Dublin has risen during the first quarter of 2014; the first quarterly rise since mid-2007. Nationally, the average asking price is now €177,000, up 3.5% from the same time last year and down 53% from the peak. Asking prices in Dublin increased by 1.3% in the first quarter of 2014, the fourth quarter in a row Dublin has recorded a price increase and puts the average asking price in the capital at €244,000.

&#160;

The European Central Bank (ECB) left its key interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.25% despite concerns about credit availability in struggling economies and falling inflation. ECB chief Mario Draghi told a news conference that he and his colleagues expected a prolonged period of low inflation and that if it dragged on too long, action in the form of quantitative easing could be taken.

&#160;

The Eurozone (EA18) seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 11.9% in February 2014. It was 12.0% in February 2013. The EU28 unemployment rate was 10.6% in February 2014, down from 10.7% in January 2014 compared with 10.9% in February 2013.

&#160;

The HSBC Emerging Markets Index (EMI), a monthly indicator derived from the PMI (purchasing managers' index) surveys, fell for the fourth month running to 50.3 in March, from 51.1 in February, indicating only a marginal increase in private sector output across global emerging markets. Output has contracted since February in three of the four largest emerging economies. China posted a marginal decline for the second month running, while India slipped back into contraction. Meanwhile, Russian private sector output fell at the fastest rate since May 2009.

&#160;

Nigeria has rebased its gross domestic product (GDP) data, which has pushed it above South Africa as the Africa’s biggest economy. Nigerian GDP now includes previously uncounted industries like telecoms, information technology, music, online sales, airlines, and film production. GDP for 2013 totalled 80.3 trillion naira ($509.9bn). That compares with South Africa's GDP of $370.3bn at the end of 2013.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me… </strong>There are a number of hazards in golf: sand traps, the rough and water. You can now add wildfires to that list. Researchers believe that titanium golf clubs are responsible for sparking wildfires in California. The reason behind this logic is that as the titanium club strikes a ball, nearby rocks can tear particles of titanium from the sole of the head and bits of the particle surfaces will react violently with oxygen or nitrogen in the air, heat is produced and foliage ignites in flames.

<strong>“Enjoy the little things, for one day you may look back and realise they were the big things<i>” </i></strong>

<i>– Robert Brault </i>

&#160;

The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) expects economic growth in Ireland to remain strong in 2014 and 2015, with GNP (gross national product) of over 3.5% forecast in both years. However, the institute warned that if measures to increase housing supply in Dublin are not implemented, the current housing shortfall could undermine recovery as higher house prices and rents make it more expensive for people to live and work in the economy.

&#160;

Greece has returned to global capital markets for the first time since the Eurozone crisis erupted in 2010, attracting big demand for its government bonds in a sign of growing confidence in the Eurozone weakest economy. Investors purchased up 3 billion euros of 5-year bonds with demand for the bonds coming in around 11 billion euros.

&#160;

The global recovery is becoming broader, but the changing external environment poses new challenges to emerging market and developing economies, says the IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook (WEO). The WEO warns of the risk from persistently low inflation/deflation in advanced economies, in particular in the Eurozone. The IMF forecasts global growth to average 3.6% in 2014, up from 3% in 2013, and to rise to 3.9% in 2015.

&#160;

China's exports slumped for the second straight month in March. The Chinese premier firmly ruled out a stimulus program highlighting that job creation was the government’ policy priority and that it did not matter if growth came in a little below the official target of 7.5%.

&#160;

According to the East Asia Pacific Economic Update developing countries in the East Asia Pacific region will see stable economic growth in 2014 (forecast of 7.1% in 2014), bolstered by a recovery in high-income economies and the market’s modest response so far to the Federal Reserve’s tapering of its quantitative easing programme.

&#160;

The Bank of Japan refrained from taking extra monetary easing measures, opting instead to continue pumping up the monetary base.

&#160;

The US has warned Beijing against manipulating its currency following a sharp depreciation (&gt;2.5%) of the renminbi since 2014.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me… </strong>Thanks to a new "interactive 3D experience" athletes the world over will be able to navigate the London marathon from the comfort of their own treadmill. Marathon organisers have combined with treadmill video producers to create a new system that combines HD video of the entire 26.2 mile.

<title>Market Review – 2014 Week16</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[&#160;

<strong>“Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new<i>”</i></strong>

<i>– Albert Einstein </i>

&#160;

The CSO published the government finances for 2013 and the figures show that the General Government Deficit continues to fall standing at 7.2% in 2013, an improvement on the 2012 position of €13.44bn (8.2% of GDP).

&#160;

The number of jobless in the UK dipped by 77,000 to a five-year low of 2.24m in the three months to February 2014.

&#160;

Italy's government approved the country's first sweeping income tax cuts in more than a decade, in an attempt to boost its economy, giving up to €80 a month in extra cash to three-quarters of the workforce.

&#160;

Economic activity in the US rebounded in recent weeks from weather-related slowdowns earlier this year, according to the Federal Reserve's "Beige Book" survey of regional economic conditions.

&#160;

Janet Yellen (Chairperson of the Federal Reserve) announced that the Federal Reserve’s policy hinges on three "big questions,” including low inflation and labour-market slack, as they consider when the economy is healthy enough to begin raising rates.

&#160;

According to the BofA Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey for April, Investor confidence in global economic growth remains high even as expectations of higher short-term rates increase. A net 66% of global fund managers believe the US is still the most over-valued equity market, little changed from March and February. A net 55% think Emerging Markets are undervalued, up from 49% in March and the highest reading ever. Only a net 2% would like to underweight emerging markets, down sharply from 21% in March.

&#160;

China's gross domestic product growth slipped to 7.4% in the Q1 2014 to its slowest level in 18 months as the world's second-largest economy continues to shift down a gear.

&#160;

Growth in residential property prices across large and medium-size Chinese cities slowed further in March as lending limits and discounts undercut demand, according to analysts and property developers.

&#160;

Both the Irish and UK commercial property markets have strengthened in Q1 of 2014 with the latest JLL Irish Property Index showing overall returns at 9.1% while, commercial property values in the UK rose by a further 1.0% in March. According to the IPD UK Monthly Property Index, values have now risen by 6.8% over the last 10 months of consecutive growth, although overall they still remain below their 2007 peak levels.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me…  </strong>The extent of China's soil pollution, long guarded as a state secret, was laid out in an official report that confirmed deep-seated fears about contaminated farmland and the viability of the country's food supply. The report highlights nearly one-fifth of its arable land is contaminated by pollution.

<strong>“One can choose to go back toward safety or forward toward growth<i>” </i></strong>

<i>– Abraham Maslow</i>

<i> </i>

Unemployment in Ireland fell to 11.8 percent in March, the lowest rate in five years. However, Eurostat has revealed Ireland is the fourth highest of the union's 28 countries for the number of long-term jobless people. The statistics show that about 60pc of those out of work are on the Live Register for more than a year.

&#160;

As earning season was well underway it has emerged European companies’ earnings growth has yet to meet expectations. Over half the 101 companies of the 374 Stoxx600 European companies that have reported so far on their first quarter performance have disappointed consensus earnings. While in the US of the 240 companies of the S&amp;P 500 that have reported earnings to date for Q1 2014, 73% have posted earnings above the average estimate.

&#160;

The Eurozone took another step to recovery after investor’s flocked to Portugal’s first regular debt auction since applying for international help in 2011, pushing its borrowing costs to their lowest level in eight years. The auction of the 10-year bond raised €750m with a yield of 3.57%, paving the way for Portugal to become the second Eurozone country after Ireland to escape from its three-year rescue programme.

&#160;

According to a report published by Davy, Ireland’s household and corporate debt levels look exceptionally high on historical and international comparisons with no sign that the pace of deleveraging is abating. Although Irish household debt has fallen by 17% from its peak in 2008, tax rises and wage cuts have hurt disposable incomes. Hence, the ratio of disposable income peaked later, in 2011, at 212% – only falling to 196% by Q3 2013. This suggests that Irish households are at an early stage of their deleveraging process. In comparison, UK household debt has fallen for six years from a peak of 170% of disposable income in 2008 to 140% in 2013.

&#160;

Warm weather and the stockpiling of gas has knocked nearly a quarter of the wholesale price of gas, according to the latest Wholesale Market Report on Irish energy prices. The crucial factor in lowering prices was warmer weather conditions since winter last year, and the absence of any major unplanned outages in sources of supply to the network. As a result, there is 27% more gas in the European system now than at the same time last year.

&#160;

The US Federal Reserve showed signs that it is highly likely to slow its asset purchases by another $10 billion in the coming weeks as the economy shakes of its winter torpor.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me… </strong>A blast from the past - In 2006 a global real estate agency compared the cost of a single-family dwelling, 2,200 square feet (approximately) four bedrooms, two and one-half baths, family room (or equivalent) and two-car garage in neighbourhoods/zip codes within a market that is typical for corporate middle-management level families, in 384 markets including 42 outside North America. It found that for the cost in Dublin of $1.4m (€1.1m), you could buy nine similar houses in Houston, Texas, three in Amsterdam, two in Sydney and almost two in Tokyo.

<strong>“Either you run the day or the day runs you<i>”</i></strong><b><i>
</i></b><i>– Jim Rohn</i>

<i> </i>

In the year to March, residential Irish property prices at a national level, increased by 7.8%. This compares with an increase of 8.1% in February and a decrease of 3.0% recorded in the twelve months to March 2013. Dublin prices are up by 14.3% in the 12 months.

&#160;

Live Register data for April shows another fall in the Irish unemployment rate to 11.7%. The unemployment rate has now fallen from 12.1% in December 2013 and from its 15.1% peak in early 2012. On a seasonally adjusted basis, there were 392,700 claimants in April, the lowest level since April 2009. The unemployment rate is now at its lowest since March 2009.

&#160;

The Eurozone (EA18) seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 11.8% in March 2014, stable since December 2013, but down from 12.0% in March 2013. The EU28 unemployment rate was 10.5% in March 2014, stable compared with February 2014, but down from 10.9% in March 2013.

&#160;

Eurozone annual inflation is expected to be 0.7% in April 2014, up from 0.5% in March, according to a flash estimate from Eurostat, the statistics office of the European Union.

&#160;

The US added jobs in April at the fastest pace in more than two years and the jobless rate plunged, signalling that the economy rebounded from a winter slide. The release marked the best month of job creation since January 2012 and the second-best month since the economy emerged from recession in mid-2009. The jobless rate dropped to 6.3% from 6.7%, hitting the lowest level since September 2008.

&#160;

US economic growth shuddered to a halt, increasing at an annual rate of 0.1% in Q1 2014, making the first quarter one of the weakest paces of the five-year recovery as poor weather appeared to have stalled business investment while weak overseas demand hit exports.

&#160;

The UK economy grew by 0.8% in the first quarter (Q1) of 2014, according to data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), indicating that the economy is now 0.6% smaller than its 2008 peak.

&#160;

According to the World Bank, Developing countries in the East Asia Pacific region will see stable economic growth in 2014, bolstered by a recovery in high-income economies and the market’s modest response to the Federal Reserve’s tapering of quantitative easing. According to the report, Developing East Asia will grow by 7.1% this year, largely unchanged from 2013. As a result, the World Bank says East Asia remains the fastest growing region in the world, despite a slowdown from the average growth rate of 8.0% from 2009 to 2013.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me…</strong> The United States has enjoyed the largest economy in the world since it displaced Great Britain in 1872. As of Friday the World Bank announced that China’s economy (growth of 24% between 2011 and 2014) will surpass the United States (growth of 7.6% between 2011 and 2014) in 2014 and take the top spot. India will become the third-largest economy having previously been in tenth place. The size of its economy almost doubled from 19% of the US in 2005 to 37% in 2011.

<strong>“Action speaks louder than words but not nearly as often<i>”
</i></strong><i>– Mark Twain</i>

<i> </i>

The Bord Gáis Energy Index fell by 5% in April as a steady supply of gas to the UK, coupled with falling demand weighed on wholesale gas prices generally. However, tensions as a result of the Ukrainian crisis and the on-going potential threat to European gas supplies did push wholesale prices higher on occasion.

&#160;

The Central Bank reported that Irish household debt declined by €2.4bn during Q4 2013, falling to €166bn or €36,203 per capita. This marked the largest decrease in debt since Q4 2012.

&#160;

Prices on average in Ireland, as measured by the CPI (consumer price index), were 0.3% higher in April compared with April 2013. The sectors which caused the largest upward contribution to the CPI in the year were Miscellaneous Goods &amp; Services (+0.38%), Restaurants &amp; Hotels (+0.30%) and Alcoholic Beverages &amp; Tobacco (+0.21%).

&#160;

The European Central Bank (ECB) left its key interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.25% despite concerns about credit availability in struggling economies and the threat of deflation. Furthermore, the European Central Bank sent an unusually strong signal that it would likely cut interest rates or take other stimulus measures in June to combat the low inflation that threatens Europe's recovery.

&#160;

The euro zone's economy grew at the fastest pace for almost three years in April, but manufacturers and service providers continued to cut their prices.

&#160;

The Bank of England left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5%, the lowest rate since 1694 when the Bank was founded

&#160;

In a further sign that the U.K.'s economic recovery continues to strengthen, activity in the key services sector expanded at the fastest pace so far this year, while jobs growth surged.

&#160;

The HSBC Emerging Markets Index (EMI), a monthly indicator derived from the PMI (purchasing managers' surveys), continued to indicate only a marginal increase in output across global emerging markets in April. The EMI posted 50.4, from 50.3 in March, well below its eight-and-a-half year long-run trend level of 53.9. Overall April data indicated falling output in the four largest emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China)

&#160;

In the latest sign of concerns over debt in China's financial system, Beijing's local banking regulator has warned banks to step up their vigilance in lending to individual borrowers.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me…  </strong>Apple is in the final stages of talks to purchase Beats Electronics (primarily a headphone manufacturer) for $3.2 billion, a fraction of Apples $150 billion cash reserves.

<strong>“Nothing is a waste of time if you use the experience wisely<i>” </i></strong>

<i>– Auguste Rodin </i>

&#160;

Moody’s has upgraded Ireland’s credit rating by two notches to Baa1 from Baa3 with a “stable outlook.” This is the second time in six months that it has raised Irelands rating.

&#160;

GDP rose by 0.2% in the Eurozone (EA18) and by 0.3% in the EU28 during the first quarter of 2014, compared with the previous quarter, according to flash estimates published by Eurostat. In the fourth quarter of 2013, GDP (gross domestic product) grew by 0.2% in the Eurozone and by 0.4% in the EU28.

&#160;

The euro zone's trade surplus shrank in March compared with the same month a year earlier, as exports and imports fell for the first time since the end of 2013.

&#160;

Germany's central bank is willing to back an array of stimulus measures by the European Central Bank next month if needed to fight unacceptably low inflation, underscoring the Bundesbank's shift away from its reputation in recent years as the euro zone's policy rebel.

&#160;

EBS released its latest EBS DKM Affordability Index showing that the Irish national housing affordability level for first time buyers remains stable at 19.3% of net income for a working couple purchasing the average property. This figure is forecasted to rise to 19.6% in the next month. While affordability is now at levels last seen by the end of 2008, it is still well below the peak level of 26.4% of net income for a working couple in December 2006, as falling interest rates and prices more than offset a rise in personal taxes.

&#160;

Bank of England officials signalled that they remain on track to raise interest rates in the U.K. early next year, as their counterparts at the European Central Bank ready fresh stimulus measures to revive a fitful recovery in the 18-nation euro zone.

&#160;

Japan's economy regained momentum in the first quarter of this year despite sluggish global growth, as domestic demand spiked in anticipation of a consumption-tax increase and improved employment.

&#160;

The number of Americans filing first-time jobless benefits fell sharply last week to a seven-year low, a sign of strength in the labour market following several weeks of instability.

&#160;

The Bank of America Merrill Lynch Fund Managers' Survey for May found that investors are sitting on more cash and have reduced equity holdings compared to a month ago. Average cash levels have reached 5% of portfolios, the highest level since June 2012 and up from 4.8% in April. A net 22% are taking below normal levels of risk, up from 11% a month ago. The proportion of asset allocators overweight equities has fallen to a net 37% from a net 45% last month.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me…  </strong>Japan will allow individuals to own inflation-linked bonds from next year in response to growing demand for protection against rising prices as the Bank of Japan continues its ultra-easy monetary policy.

<strong>“Live out your imagination, not your history<i>” </i></strong>

<i>– Stephen Covey </i>

&#160;

Ahead of European elections on the weekend, Irish 10-year government bond yields rose by 9 basis points to 2.81%, their highest level since May 2nd

&#160;

Sentiment gained little from a mixed bag of European PMIs, indicating that the recovery in Q2 remained reliant on Germany, with France contracting. UK GDP growth was unrevised at 0.8% in Q1, with the recovery broadening out into investment spending.

&#160;

According to an official with the European Central Bank, the ECB is more concerned with low growth or stagnation combined with low inflation or even deflation, and increasing levels of public debt than with inflation.

&#160;

IMD the Swiss business school announced its annual world competitiveness ranking. As part of its ranking, the IMD World Competitiveness Center also looks at perceptions of each country as a place to do business. The top 3 are US, Switzerland and Singapore with Ireland in 15th place up from 17th in 2013 and behind Malaysia with a 12th rank.

&#160;

Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said he saw little reason for the yen to strengthen against key currencies, signalling concern that a further rebound could cast a shadow over the Japanese economy and the central bank's fight against deflation.

&#160;

The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose last week but the total number of unemployed people drawing benefits has hit a post-recession low, a sign of general improvement in the U.S. labour market.

&#160;

Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney spelled out a series of potential risks to the U.K. economy, noting that the central bank has a wary eye on the housing market and signalling that officials are uncomfortable with the strength of the pound. Mark Carney seems determined to leave U.K. rates as low as possible as long as possible, when they finally start to go up, to raise them slowly.

&#160;

Fitch Ratings on Friday upgraded Greece's sovereign rating to B from B-, still in junk territory

&#160;

A key gauge of China's factory activity showed signs of stabilising in May, but the world's second largest economy was still struggling to gain traction and analysts said more government help might be needed in the months ahead.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me…</strong> amid growing concerns about the strength of France's economic recovery France's national rail company announced on Tuesday it had ordered 2,000 trains for an expanded regional network that are too wide for many station platforms

<strong>“To climb steep hills requires slow pace at first<i>”</i></strong>

<b><i> </i></b><i>– William Shakespeare </i>

&#160;

In the year to April, residential property prices on a national level, increased by 8.5%. This compares with an increase of 7.8% in March and a decrease of 1.2% recorded in the twelve months to April 2013. Dublin prices rose 3.1% in the month and are up 17.8% in 12 months. The price of residential properties in the rest of Ireland fell by 0.3% in April compared with an increase of 1.2% in April of last year.

&#160;

The International Monetary Fund announced that the Bank of Japan may need to maintain its current pace of monetary easing for an extended period to give Prime Minister Shinzo Abe time to complete his economic revival agenda.

&#160;

Japan remained the world's largest net creditor nation in 2013, but China made steady gains. That is little surprise, given Japan's expanding trade deficits and low returns on foreign assets. China, on the other hand, runs large trade surpluses.

&#160;

The European Central Bank warned that the main risk for European financial markets is a reversal in potentially "fickle" capital inflows into the euro zone, a factor which has benefited banks and governments in recent months through lower borrowing costs.

&#160;

Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services on Friday upgraded Spain's long- and short-term foreign and local currency sovereign ratings to BBB/A-2 from BBB-/A-3.

&#160;

German lawmakers adopted a controversial bill that will lower the retirement age and raise pension payments for some workers at a cost of $218 billion through 2030.

&#160;

Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan signed a treaty formally creating the Eurasian Economic Union, as President Vladimir Putin pushes forward with his goal of reintegrating the economies of the former Soviet Union and creating a counterbalance to the European Union.

&#160;

Bank lending to euro-zone businesses fell in April, marking nearly two years of declines and indicating that credit scarcity is still a drag on the currency area's weak economic recovery.

&#160;

Revised GDP figures indicate that the U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter, the latest stumble for a recovery that has struggled to find its footing since recession ended almost five years ago. U.S. 1Q preliminary GDP contracted at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0%; economists predicted a 0.6% decline.

&#160;

Narendra Modi, the son of a tea seller with political roots in India's Hindu nationalist movement, was sworn in as prime minister of the world's largest democracy, putting in place a leaner central government and promising Indians "a glorious future."

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me…</strong> The Italian government has decided to include illegal economically productive activity in their estimates of the country’s GDP in a bid to boost its shaky economy.

<title>Aiming for top class claims service</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year we paid over 2,500 claim payments worth over €168 million to families right across Ireland. Making a claim is not something you do every day and we know it can feel very daunting at a time when you are already feeling vulnerable. The way we look at it is when someone makes a claim this is our moment to try to be our absolute best. That’s why we’ve a team of over 20 dedicated claims handlers who are specially trained to help make the process as easy as possible. We know that we can’t take away people’s loss or help them through their illness but we aim to provide the best claims service we possibly can.

<strong>We aim for a 10 out of 10 service</strong>

I work on our customer satisfaction research team and every month we have an independent research company call our customers who made specified illness cover claims with us to get their feedback on the service that they received.

In 2013 customers scored us:
<ul style="padding-left: 15px !important; list-style-type: disc;">
<li>9.4/10 for our claims team being helpful, knowledgeable and keeping their promises.</li>
<li>9.3/10 for the speed of paying their claim.</li>
<li>9.2/10 for our claims team treating them fairly.</li>
</ul>
We measure to decimal places because we want to get those scores as close to 10 as possible!

Within that customer feedback I regularly see examples of how our claims team really go out of their way to help our customers. Here are just a few examples:
<ul style="padding-left: 15px !important; list-style-type: disc;">
<li style="padding: 5px;">Deborah was reviewing a death claim that was paid for a customer. She noticed that the illness the customer had might fall under one of our definitions for specified illness cover. Deborah requested further medical information from the hospital and her investigations meant that as well as paying the original life claim we would also be sending the family another cheque for a separate specified illness cover claim.</li>
<li style="padding: 5px;">Shane one of our financial advisers spotted that a customer mentioned a previous illness in a meeting in relation to a different plan. He passed this to the claims team who saw the customer had another plan with Specified Illness Cover. Shane encouraged and helped the customer to make a claim when the customer didn’t think they could. This led to a full claim paid to the customer.</li>
<li style="padding: 5px;">Nuala was contacted by an adviser to let her know about a customer who needed to make an urgent claim as they were receiving private treatment for their illness. Nuala told the adviser exactly what was needed for the claim and the adviser arranged this the same day. The claim came in on a Monday and the cheque was received by the customer on the Thursday.</li>
</ul>
9 out of every 10 of our claims customers would recommend us to family and friends. That’s something that we’re really proud of.

Source: The Leadership Factor, December 2012 - December 2013. 104 of 818 Specified Illness claims paid in 2013 surveyed.

as you wrote the guide in it or something. I think that you 
can do with a few p.c. to pressure the message home 
a bit, however instead of that, that is magnificent blog.
An excellent read. I'll certainly be back.]]></wp:comment_content>

<strong>“You will never find time for anything. If you want the time you must make it.<i>”</i></strong>

<b><i> </i></b><i>– Charles Buxton </i>

&#160;

Ireland’s credit rating was upgraded one level by Standard &amp; Poor’s. The rating was raised to A- from BBB+ with a positive outlook.

&#160;

The Bord Gáis Energy Index was unchanged month-on-month in May with rising Brent crude oil prices being offset by falling wholesale gas and electricity prices. In May 2014 the Index stood at 133 which is 3% lower than 12 months ago.

&#160;

Boosted by new export orders from the U.K., Irish manufacturing orders posted its 12th successive monthly rise in May.

&#160;

Eurozone annual inflation is expected to be 0.5% in May 2014, down from 0.7% in April, according to a flash estimate from Eurostat, the statistics office of the European Union.

&#160;

The European Central Bank took extraordinary steps Thursday to stave off the threat of low inflation in Europe cutting the benchmark interest rate from 0.25% to 0.15% and the deposit rate for bank funds to a negative 0.10% in a bid to get banks to lend more to credit-starved customers.

&#160;

The Eurozone (EA18) seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 11.7% in April 2014, down from 11.8% in March 2014, and from 12.0% in April 2013. The EU28 unemployment rate was 10.4% in April 2014, down from 10.5% in March 2014, and from 10.9% in April 2013. The lowest rate was in Austria at 4.9% and the highest was in Greece at 26.5%.

&#160;

The Bank of England kept its official rate at 0.5%, the lowest rate since the bank was founded by a charter signed in 1694.

&#160;

A member of the Bank of England's financial stability panel noted that the U.K. economy is still fragile despite a recent growth spurt and its financial system remains vulnerable to a variety of risks from at home and abroad.

&#160;

U.S. nonfarm payrolls advanced a seasonally adjusted 217,000 last month, providing renewed evidence that the five-year-long recovery accelerated this spring. The jobless rate was unchanged at 6.3%. Nonfarm payroll employment fell by 8.7m from January 2008 through February 2010. Since then, employment has risen by 8.8m meaning all the jobs that were lost during the recession have been recovered. Of course the population has also increased since 2008.

&#160;

The net worth of U.S. households and non-profit organizations rose roughly 2% in the first quarter to $81.8 trillion, the highest on record, according to a report by the Federal Reserve.

&#160;

According to the World Bank China's economy is expected to record slower growth over the medium term, but Beijing has the ability to roll out economic support measures to meet its official target of about 7.5% this year.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me… </strong>The 10-year German bund yield is close to its lowest since the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[With Father's Day around the corner, we surveyed 300 Irish Dads in a poll of "Most Inspiring Father". Barack Obama (1st) and Michael D. Higgins (2nd) topped the poll, with Keith Duffy and Ronan O'Gara following in 5th and 6th place respectively.

&#160;

Our survey revealed some other insights into fathers in Ireland today including:

<strong>1. ‘Dad’</strong> is the most popular name for fathers (52%) with <b>‘Da’</b> (11%) and <b>‘Daddy’</b> (8%) the other most popular names.

&#160;

<strong>2. 27%</strong> of those surveyed claim ‘seeing their children grow and develop’ as the best part of being a father.

&#160;

<strong>3. 31%</strong> of those surveyed would consider a weekend away with their wife/partner as the ideal gift for Father’s Day, compared to <b>just 4%</b> who would prefer a golf day out with friends

&#160;

<strong>4.</strong> Playing in the park’ topped the poll at the favourite way to spend time with children (28%) with football being called out as the best game to play.

On a more serious note, children’s health ranks as the main concern for 1 in 3 fathers in Ireland today, ahead of being a good role model. Financial concerns are a concern for 2 in 5, a third cite providing for their children while a quarter refer to not being around for their children.

We've also made an infograph of our main research findings - have a look below.

<strong>“We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are<i>”</i></strong>

<b><i> </i></b><i>– Anais Nin </i>

&#160;

According to the Central Bank Ireland's recovery is under way, but its fragile lenders and the large amounts of debt held by households pose considerable threats to stability.

&#160;

Research shows that Irish consumer spending and debt changes are highly dependent on house prices with the impact greater than most other countries.

&#160;

According to the quarterly Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB)/ESRI Rent Index,on an annual basis nationally, rents were 3.5% higher than in quarter 1 of 2013. Nationally, rents for houses were 1.6% higher, while apartment rents were 5.6% higher than in the same quarter of 2013. Annual growth in the Dublin market was stronger, up by 8.4%, with Dublin house rents up by 6.7% and Dublin apartment rents higher by 10.3%. In the 12 months to end of March 2014 Rents in Dublin rose ten times the level outside the capital.

&#160;

The CSO announced that consumer prices as measured by the CPI (consumer price index) were 0.4% higher in May compared with May 2013. The most notable changes in the year were increases in Education (+4.5%), Miscellaneous Goods &amp; Services (+4.0%), Alcoholic Beverages &amp; Tobacco (+3.4%) and Restaurants &amp; Hotels (+2.2%). There were decreases in Communications (-4.7%), Clothing &amp; Footwear (-3.5%), Furnishings, Household Equipment &amp; Routine Household Maintenance (-3.2%) and Food &amp; Non-Alcoholic Beverages (- 1.9%).

&#160;

The U.K.'s two chief financial-policy makers warned in strident tones that the British fervour for real estate had swelled into a threat to the wider economy, and the government moved to enact new powers to curb mortgage lending amid a gathering boom.

&#160;

The UK unemployment level fell by 161,000 to 2.16m in the three months to April, bringing the unemployment rate down to 6.6%. Meanwhile UK employment rose again at a record pace in the three months to April but average earnings growth fell substantially below inflation.

&#160;

Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services revised its outlook on the U.K. to stable from negative, pointing to the robust and broadening recovery in the country's economy.

&#160;

The Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said that U.K. interest rates could rise sooner than investors expect, sending the clearest signal yet that Britain's central bank is inching closer to calling time on record-low borrowing costs.

&#160;

A gauge of U.S. inflation ticked lower, a sign price pressures remain tame amid subdued economic growth. The producer-price index for final demand fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in May from a month earlier. Economists expected a 0.2% rise.

&#160;

The harsh U.S. winter and the Ukraine conflict have chilled the outlook for economic growth, but highly developed economies will lead a rebound later in the year, the World Bank projected cutting its global growth estimate to 2.8% from 3.2%

&#160;

China's economy is struggling to find equilibrium, with government stimulus measures gaining traction last month while the vital housing market continues its swoon.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me… </strong>Out of the 19 FIFA World Cup tournaments so far, 6 tournaments have only been won by the host Country.

<strong>“All great achievements have one thing in common - people with a passion to succeed.<i>”</i></strong>

– Pat Cash

&#160;

Minister for Finance Michael Noonan indicated that he believes a €2bn budgetary adjustment in 2015 will not be necessary to meet the deficit target of 3% of GDP. This follows recommendations from the IMF for a €2bn adjustment in Budget 2015, focused on better targeted social spending in place of costly universal benefit payments and widening the base of products subject to VAT.

&#160;

In measures of per capita consumption and GDP (gross domestic product) the typical German living standard is the highest in Europe while the Irish, Italians and Spanish are among the Eurozone's poorest, according to data published by Eurostat, the EU's statistics office.

&#160;

In 2013 Irish prices for consumer goods and services were 18% above the European Union (EU) average despite Ireland being the only member country to have experienced a fall in prices in the period 2008-2012.

&#160;

The International Monetary Fund announced that the European Central Bank should consider buying assets, including sovereign bonds, on a large scale, if inflation in the euro zone remains low.

&#160;

While the recent upheaval in Iraq remained largely supportive for oil prices, as with other recent geopolitical flare-ups, the spill over to equities was limited

&#160;

German investor sentiment dipped to an 18-month low in June as the ZEW Economic Expectations for Germany lost 3.3 points. Now standing at 29.8 points (long-term average: 24.7 points), the indicator has decreased for the sixth time in a row.

&#160;

The IMF cut its forecast for US economic growth by 0.8 percentage point to 2%, citing a harsh winter, a struggling housing market and weak international demand for the country's products

&#160;

Global investors have regained an appetite for risk against the backdrop of strong liquidity and a fairly positive economic outlooks. According to the BofA Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey for June a net 66% of respondents expect the global economy to strengthen over the next year. A net 48% of asset allocators are overweight equities, up 11%, even though a net 15% now regard the asset class as over-valued, this measure’s strongest response since 2000. Appetite for real estate has also risen. The net 6% overweight reported ranks as the highest in eight years. In contrast, underweight positions in bonds (now regarded as over-valued by a net 75%) have reached their highest level since the end of 2013.

&#160;

Janet Yellen’s second news conference as Fed chair conveyed no new information about the timing of future interest rate moves. However she noted noting that the Federal Reserve Bank has trimmed back its stimulus program by $10bn a month to $35bn beginning July.

&#160;

Argentina unveiled a plan to change the terms of its bonds that aims to prevent the country's second default in 13 years, while continuing a long-running battle with a small group of creditors.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me…</strong><b>  </b>Brazil are the only team to have featured in all 19 World Cups played so far

<strong>“When you come to a roadblock, take a detour.<i>”</i></strong>

<i>– Mary Kay Ash </i>

&#160;

Residential property prices at a national level, increased by 10.6% in the 12 months to May. This compares with an increase of 8.5% in April and a decrease of 1.1% recorded in the twelve months to May 2013. However, residential property prices are still 47.0% lower than their highest level in September 2007.

&#160;

One year ago, Croatia joined the European Union sparking hopes that membership of the rich 28-nation bloc would transform the fortunes of the tourism-dependent economy. But as the anniversary looms, the hoped-for boom has largely failed to materialise. Croatia remains one of the bloc's weakest economies, mired in a seemingly never-ending recession that has pushed unemployment to 20 percent; half of the country's youth are without a job.

&#160;

Bulgaria, the European Union’s poorest member state, raised €1.5bn in a new government bond issue that attracted orders of €4bn against a backdrop of political and financial uncertainty in the country.

&#160;

US real gross domestic product (GDP) fell an annualised 2.9% in the first quarter of 2014, according to the third estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This is the fastest rate of decline since the first quarter of 2009, when output fell 5.4% and has been mainly blamed on bad weather.

&#160;

The Bank of England has become the first leading central bank to try to prevent a new credit boom after it imposed limits on mortgage borrowing. Limiting the proportion of mortgages a bank can issue with large loans relative to the borrowers incomes.

&#160;

Growing appetite by U.S. investors for South Korean debt has fueled a record pace of bond issuance this year as buyers judge the country to be one of the safest places to park their money within the region.

&#160;

Central bank reserve managers across the world are ready to take a more cautious approach to investment as the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to reduce its monetary stimulus, with the full effect of such tapering still to be felt so far as demand for riskier assets is concerned.

&#160;

The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) released its annual report noting that its overall impression is that the global economy is healing but remains unbalanced. Growth has picked up, but long-term prospects are not that bright. Financial markets are euphoric, but progress in strengthening banks' balance sheets has been uneven and private debt keeps growing. Macroeconomic policy has little room for manoeuvre to deal with any untoward surprises that might be sprung, including a normal recession.

&#160;

A gauge of China's factory activity (HSBC PMI) showed fresh signs of strength in June, hitting a seven-month high of 50.8, pointing to improvement in the world's second-largest economy as export demand improves and a government stimulus program takes hold.

&#160;

<strong>The Story of the week for me… </strong>The first FIFA World Cup was held in Uruguay back in 1930 and 13 countries participated in the very first tournament.

<p align="center"><b> </b></p>
<b>3rd July 2014 – </b>Irish Life announced today that its investment manager was named Equities Manager of the Year and Passive Manager of the Year at the European Pension Awards 2014. Irish Life Investment Managers was the only Irish investment company to be recognised in this year’s awards and the only manager to win two awards in 2014.

These prestigious European awards, now in their 7<sup>th</sup> year, recognise outstanding achievement in the varied fields of European pension provision, honouring the investment firms, consultancies and pension providers across Europe that have set the professional standards in order to best serve European pension funds in these increasingly challenging times.

This year’s awards received more entries than the previous six years. As with previous years the judges were drawn from across the European pensions sphere to include providers, pension funds, consultants and representatives from various European pensions and investment associations. Commenting on the win, Patrick Burke, Managing Director of Irish Life Investment Managers said:
<blockquote>“This is a great honour for our team and we are grateful to the European Pension Awards for this recognition.  We believe these awards are testament to Irish Life’s customer first focus and our ability to provide innovative solutions, which is core to our business.”

“Our objective is to understand the evolving needs of our customers and to provide inspired investment solutions to our growing client base – solutions which will provide the opportunity for growth while employing strategies that deliver protection in times of market stress. Listening to our clients and developing solutions according to their wants and needs has been critical to achieving our objectives and continuing to grow our business – the strategies which were recognised with these awards form the foundation of the Irish Life MAPS range of funds and consequently we are very pleased that they have been recognised in this manner.”</blockquote>
Irish Life Investment Managers came up against some of the leading global managers to be named equity manager of the year. The category recognises the manager who has led the way in managing equities in the past 12 months and has proved itself to be the most exceptional player in the industry and invaluable to European pension funds.

The passive manager award recognises the manager which demonstrates strong returns, provides excellent customer service and shows a true understanding of the needs of their clients.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Earnings Season provides further support for equity markets, but the outlook is unclear</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>SUMMARY:With quarter three earnings season almost complete, Ruth Cooney takes a look at the headline figures and assesses the outlook for 2011.</h4>
Although central bank policy and Eurozone sovereign concerns have been dominating the headlines, the third quarter earnings season both in Europe and the US has provided a support for markets. With the third quarter reporting season 90% complete for the S&amp;P 500 companies and 50% complete for MSCI Europe companies, the trends seen over previous quarters continued for the third quarter. Aggressive cost cutting persisted for the sixth consecutive quarter and exposure to emerging market economies continued to push earnings higher than analysts' expectations. Revenues, however, fell short of expectations in the US, although European companies reported stronger revenues than expected. The outlook also remained uncertain as expectations for the fourth quarter were left unchanged but forecasts for 2011 have been revised lower.

<strong>Third Quarter Earnings Forecasts have risen substantially since the start of the reporting season</strong>
<img src="http://www.irishlife.ie/uploadedImages/Research/thirdquarterearningsforcast.png" alt="" />

<strong>Companies continue to cut costs amid the gradual and volatile economic recovery:</strong>

The third quarter earnings season results have supported equity markets in that 73% of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported to date have beaten earnings expectations, while 44% of MSCI Europe companies that have reported have delivered above consensus earnings. S&amp;P 500 earnings were 31% higher than the third quarter 2009. Continued aggressive cost cutting delivered the strong performance in the US as revenues continued to miss expectations. In Europe, on the other hand, the economic recovery was more evident as much of the better than expected earnings was underpinned by improved revenues as well as increased efficiencies.

The uncertain economic outlook in the US and lacklustre recovery in revenues has resulted in further costs cuts and a reluctance of companies to fully commit to capital investments or to engage in significant rehiring of labour. Companies in the US continued to note the lack of clear signposts to healthy demand, particularly from the US consumer. In contrast the European companies with exposure to the consumer had mixed comments with slower growth observed in developed markets.

<strong>Emerging markets continued to drive earnings, offsetting a lacklustre performance from developed market.</strong>

Companies with exposure to the emerging market region saw double digit growth, albeit some companies noted that this was from a very low base. As a result companies are making strategic investments in these regions to take advantage of the longer term growth outlook from these regions. The region that companies have highlighted is the BRIC region (Brazil, Russia, India and China). The strong growth rates achieved in these regions have been offset by flat to low single digit growth rates that are being observed in the developed markets. As a result companies are committing the majority of their capital investment and hiring strategies towards these regions. This was particularly evident in the technology sectors where firms are already very internationally exposed.

<strong>Rising commodity prices have prompted fears of future margin pressure</strong>

Commodity prices have rallied strongly over the past few weeks and have spurred inflationary concerns. Companies are anticipating that these increases in input prices will be offset by continued efficiency gains or further operating cost cuts. However there are concerns that given the lacklustre performance of the developed economies, particularly the consumer, that there will be a limited potential for the companies to pass on higher prices, and hence may pressure margins over the coming quarters.

<strong>Outlook for earnings remains less transparent</strong>

Although companies continued to report better than expected earnings, confidence in future earnings outlook remained cautious. In general forecasts for the fourth quarter were left unchanged, while a modest downgrade was seen for 2011 estimates in both Europe and the US. The weakness was attributed to the subdued recovery in revenues and the impact of higher input prices. 2011 negative earnings revisions were most evident in the energy sector but the financial and utility sectors also suffered downgrades. These downgrades were not evident in every sector as earnings estimates for the technology sectors as well as the consumer discretionary sectors were revised higher, particularly as these sectors tend to have a higher exposure to the emerging market region. Also after six consecutive quarters of cost cutting the ability of companies to continue to cut costs is more limited.

<strong>2011 Earnings forecast continued to be revised modestly lower</strong>
<img src="http://www.irishlife.ie/uploadedImages/Research/2011epsestimates.png" alt="" />

These earnings reports have been supportive of the gains made in equity markets since the start of October. However the lack of transparency around the economic outlook has tainted the outlook for earnings growth going into next year. A more convincing recovery in revenues, particularly in the US would provide a further catalyst for equity market going into 2011. However the overhang of further downgrades to 2011 forecasts in this fragile economic recovery as well as concerns of input price inflation may remain a drag for equity markets going into the year end.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Why did the four year plan fail to help Irish
government bond markets?</h1>
<div id="articleRight">

Monday, 29th November 2010  Ruth Cooney is markets economist with Irish Life Investment Managers

</div>
<div id="articleMain">
<h4>SUMMARY: The four year austerity plan announced by the government last week failed to calm market jitters because of unrealistic growth targets and continued uncertainty about the overall cost of the bank bailout</h4>
The government released the much awaited four year plan on Wednesday (November 24th), despite the uncertain political environment that erupted at the start of the week. The four year plan was seen as a way for the government to regain credibility and show bond markets its ability to tackle its problems, but most importantly convince investors that it can reduce the government's deficit as a percentage of GDP to 3% by 2014, in line with Maastricht guidelines. This deadline has been extended to 2015 with the announcement of the EU-IMF Deal.

However the response by markets has not been the desired one in that the spread of the Irish ten year government bond over the German ten year government bond has increased from 5.86% to 6.43%, implying the Irish ten year government bond is yielding 9.3% (bid price). Elsewhere there have been increased contagion effects as the spreads have also widened for other peripheral countries such as Spain and Portugal, while the Euro has also fallen against many of the major currencies including the Dollar, Sterling and the Yen.

<strong>Peripheral Government bond spreads widened</strong>

<strong>Concerns about the recovery and the cost of the Banks' bailout have yet to be addressed:</strong>

In my view there are two main reasons for the lack of credibility of the plan. Firstly the economic growth expectations are now seen by the market as unrealistic, which implies that additional cuts will have to be made. Secondly the plan does not consider the crux of the government's problems, i.e. the cost of bailing out the banking sector and more importantly the interest that is likely to fall due on the loans to be taken out to finance this bailout.

<strong>The economic assumptions which the plan is based upon</strong>
<img src="http://www.irishlife.ie/uploadedImages/Investments/research/economicassumptions.png" alt="" />

<strong>The risks to the economic outlook are to the downside:-</strong>

The plan assumes that the Irish economy will grow by an average of 2.75% growth over the four years with slower growth in 2011 being offset by over 3% growth in 2012 and 2013. As to be expected that domestic recovery will lag and the bulk of the recovery is coming from exports. Exports are expected to grow by 5% in 2011 and 2012, even though the advanced economies, who are Ireland's predominant trading partners, are only expected to grow by between 2-3%, according to the latest IMF October World Economic Outlook. The inflation forecasts are also demanding as the government is assuming that prices will increase by on average of 1.3% over the four years, despite the current deflationary policies being adopted aimed at restoring competitiveness, such as cutting the minimum wage.

Therefore the EU and IMF extension of one year in order to meet the 3% deficit target by 2015 over the weekend is welcomed. It does not mean that the €15bln savings can be stretched over this period as additional savings will have to be made in 2015 if the recovery is slower than the government have predicted. Then if the interest on the debt that is available to the government to bail out the banking sector is included, the 3% deficit target seems even more challenging.

<h2>It could be worse…</h2>
Monday, 8th November 2010  Pat O'Sullivan is head of investment strategy with Irish Life

<div id="articleMain">
<h4>SUMMARY: Pat O'Sullivan takes a look at the outlook for the Irish economy over the next four years, and finds some positives for      the future in current household savings rates.</h4>
The government announced that a further €6 billion will be extracted from the economy in 2011, the 10-year Irish government bond is yielding 7.74%, the weather has turned decidedly nasty and there were more empty seats in the Aviva stadium than in the Dail. Hard to believe that it could be worse, but at least we will get free cheese to comfort us in our times of sorrow. However, in view of the time of year, a good bottle of Bordeaux would have been more appropriate, at least then we could have drowned our sorrows.

To add to the overall bonhomie of last week, the Department of Finance (DoF) released an Information Note on the outlook for the economy and the budgetary position for 2011 to 2014. This shouldn't be confused with the now (in)famous 4-year plan. This will be published sometime later this month (but probably not before the South West Donegal by-election is out of the way). However, this information note probably lays the ground work for the 4-year plan and points to a less than rosy outlook for the Irish economy.

The following table summarises the main economic forecasts outlined in the Information Note:

<strong>Source: Information Note on the Economic and Budgetary Outlook 2011-2014, Department of Finance</strong>Simply put, the DoF doesn't expect much in the way of growth next year, but the economy is expected to pick up some steam from 2012 onwards. The key driver of growth over the coming years will be the export sector as domestic demand is expected to remain anaemic, as is the case currently. Domestic demand is expected to fall again next year due to the fact that, "personal savings rates look set to remain at fairly elevated levels, given the need for households to repair their balance sheets. With household disposable income forecast to be broadly unchanged, consumer spending is projected to be flat in real terms next year. Government consumption is forecast to fall by 3%, due to the impact of further budgetary consolidation." From 2012 onwards, the economy will still be dependant on strong export growth, while the domestic engine is expected to continue spluttering under the weight of a high savings ratio. Households are expected to use these savings to repair their balance sheets, with a focus on paying off debt.

<strong>Household balance sheets and household savings</strong>

According to the Central Statistics Office, net savings of households increased from €3.6bn in 2008 to over €11bn in 2009 – the only sector to show an increase in savings over this period. The derived household net saving ratio, which expresses net savings as a percentage of net disposable income, increased from 3.9% in 2008 to 12.3% in 2009. It can be expected that the household savings ratio will fluctuate in the range of 10% to 12% this year and for the foreseeable future given the pressing need of households to repair their balance sheets. However, the source of household savings won't come from accelerating incomes but rather from more frugal habits. Consequently, while the net disposable income of households fell by €2.1bn, from €91.7bn in 2008 to €89.6bn in 2009, the €10bn decline in consumption by households down to €81bn in 2009 was far more pronounced.

<strong>Irish Household Savings Ratio – neither a borrower nor lender be: a bit late but we are all savers now!</strong>
<img src="http://www.irishlife.ie/uploadedImages/Research/householdsavingsratio.png" alt="" />

While much of the savings have been precautionary in nature - and are either sitting in cash or paying off debt - it does mean that at some stage in the future there will be significant pent up demand for consumption and investment products. The risk adverse nature of the overall economy is highly understandable and is unlikely to change anytime soon. Nevertheless, Irish households have the capacity to save in the region of €10 billion a year and this should go a long way towards repairing very fragile balance sheets.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left">The summer is well upon us now and the weather has not been too bad. When we think of good weather we instantly think barbeques, beaches and of course swimming. One major concern of the warm weather is your skin but another concern which is often forgotten is how to be safe in the water.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">In 2011 128 people drowned in Ireland. Of these 128 fatalities 56 of these where accidents, the highest number of accidental drowning’s in Ireland since 2002. A further breakdown of the facts shows a massive divide between males and females. In total 48 males accidently drowned compared to just 8 females.  A breakdown of the ages of death shows another trend with the majority of deaths falling between the ages of 24 and 64.</p>
<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Capture1.png"><img class="wp-image-2290 aligncenter" style="border: 0px;margin-top: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px" alt="Capture" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Capture1-300x131.png" width="450" height="220" /></a>

The majority of these accidental drowning’s occurred inland and are preventable. By following a few simple guidelines this accidental drowning rate can be largely reduced.

&#160;

<img class=" wp-image-2306 alignleft" alt="swim alone sign" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/swim-alone-sign.gif" width="110" height="130" />

(1) NEVER SWIM ALONE – No matter if you’re swimming in the sea, in a lake, in a river or in a private pool never swim alone. Its common belief that children are they only ones who need to be protected in the water but the fact is we all need looking after. As the facts above point out the main group responsible for these deaths is the adult male group. This is the group of people most   likely to take the risks in the water. Adult males (especially younger) see themselves as being invincible and capable of doing anything. Well this is wrong the water is stronger then you will ever be. Always swim with another capable swimmer.

&#160;

<a href="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Know-Your-Limits.png"><img class=" wp-image-2309 alignleft" alt="Know Your Limits" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Know-Your-Limits-219x300.png" width="110" height="130" /></a>

(2) Know your limits – We all have different abilities in the water and it our own responsibility to know our own. Your ability in the water should be a major consideration when deciding where to swim. If you’re a swimmer of weak ability you should not be swimming in areas where you will be unable to touch the ground. The chances of a swimmer with a weak ability coming into difficulties are much larger than the chances of a strong swimmer.

&#160;

&#160;

<em><img class="wp-image-2312 alignleft" alt="Swim In Safe Areas" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Swim-In-Safe-Areas-202x300.jpg" width="110" height="130" /></em>

(3) Swim in safe areas only – When swimming it’s always best to swim in areas monitored by trained lifeguards. This is not always possible but a certain amount of thought should be used to decide where to swim. If an area has a sign telling people not swim there listen to the message as there is a good reason for the presence of the sign. Areas such as quarries and reservoirs must always be avoided. These dangerous areas are very deep and often contain undergrowth and underlying currents (these conditions can also be found in rivers and lakes).

&#160;

&#160;

(4) NEVER swim after the consumption of alcohol – After the consumption of alcohol there are a number of things which we should not do,

<img class=" wp-image-2313 alignleft" alt="Never Drink And Swim" src="http://blog.irishlife.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Never-Drink-And-Swim-211x300.jpg" width="110" height="130" />

one of these is go for a swim. Drinking alcohol impairs your senses, encouraging risk-taking behaviour, meani
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>ng you are more likely to get into trouble. If you drink and get into the water, tired muscles and confusion from being under the influence of alcohol, makes it harder to get out of trouble. There is a range of physical changes which occur when an individual consumes alcohol and then engages in aquatic activity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<strong>“Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.<i>”</i></strong>

<b><i> </i></b><i>– Robert Collier</i>

Irish Life Investment Managers was named Equities Manager of the Year and Passive Manager of the Year at the European Pension Awards 2014. Irish Life Investment Managers was the only Irish investment company to be recognised in this year’s awards and the only manager to win two awards in 2014

Ireland’s economy surged in the first quarter of this year on the back of rapidly rising exports as the CSO posted a GDP (Gross Domestic Product) figure of 2.7% for Q1.

In a sign that the price surge in the property market is gaining momentum, asking prices in Dublin continue to increase this quarter while price growth has also extended to the national market. The mix adjusted average asking price in Dublin increased by 4.5% in Q2 2014, the largest increase since Q1 2006. The national mix adjusted average asking price grew by 1.3% for the same period, the first such increase since the peak of the market in Q4 2006.

Continuing steep rises in wholesale oil prices have offset declines in wholesale natural gas prices this month leaving the Bord Gáis Irish Energy Index unchanged month-on-month in June, but is still up 33% since December 2009.

European Central Bank President Mario Draghi kept the door open to additional stimulus including large-scale asset purchases if needed to fight excessively low inflation, while rejecting concerns over super-easy monetary policies at the ECB and other central banks.

The European Commission approved an emergency request by Bulgaria to grant a credit line of $2.3 billion to its lenders after the country suffered runs on two banks.

The euro zone's annual rate of inflation (0.5%) was unchanged at its lowest level in more than four years in June.

Janet Yellen pushed back strongly against the notion the central bank should consider raising interest rates to avoid fuelling future financial crises, in her most detailed and forceful comments on financial stability since taking the Federal Reserve's helm in February.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 17000 for the first time after a stronger-than-expected report on U.S. job creation helped reassure investors that economic growth can support stock benchmarks at all-time highs.

UK house prices have overtaken their 2007 peak, with the annual growth in home prices rising to to 11.8% in June from 11.1% a month earlier. The increase in June was the 14th straight month of house price increases.

MPs have called on the UK’s financial watchdog to investigate allegations of price rigging in the London gold market.

Indonesia has become the latest emerging economy to tap the euro debt market selling 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) worth of seven-year notes at 2.976%.

<strong>The Story of the week for me… </strong>Germany and Brazil hold the top spot for most appearances in the World Cup final. Both countries have made it to the finals on 7 different occasions.
